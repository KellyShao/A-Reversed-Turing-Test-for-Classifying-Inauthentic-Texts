1513,"Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.30% amended its policies last week to block app developers from harvesting address-book data, according to a Bloomberg report published Tuesday afternoon. Bloomberg said that app developers would sometimes ask users for permission to access their contacts and either sell the contact lists or use them for marketing.

Apple's new policy doesn't affect information that's already been shared with app developers, and users who revoke an app's contact-access privileges can't get the data back that they've previously shared, Bloomberg said. Apple executives have emphasized the company's stance on privacy in the wake of Facebook Inc.'s FB, -1.55% Cambridge Analytica scandal. Apple shares are up 0.3% in Tuesday trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.77% is little changed. "
