","Rep. Chris Collins, the New York Republican charged this week with insider trading using family members holding the stock of an Australian biotech firm on whose board he served, said Saturday he will now suspend his pursuit of reelection in November. Collins, who has said he will fight the charges brought by the SEC, had first said this week that he would stick to the race as the Republicans fight to maintain a thin edge in the House. ""Democrats are laser focused on taking back the House, electing Nancy Pelosi Speaker and then launching impeachment proceedings against President Trump,"" Collins, considered the first member of Congress to endorse a candidate Trump, said in a tweeted statement. ""They would like nothing more than to elect an 'Impeach Trump' Democrat in this District, which is something that neither our country or my party can afford."" It wasn't immediately clear if the party would be able to remove his name from the ballot.",2018-08-11T10:48:00-04:00,"

                                         rare disease drug Onpattro has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, marking the first approval of a therapy that employs the RNA interference (RNAi) gene-silencing technique. Onpattro, also called patisiran, is also the first FDA-approved drug for the rare and progressive disease hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, or malfunction of bodily nerves. It was shown in clinical trials to improve polyneuropathy and other symptoms. The drug will have an average annual list price of $450,000, though the average effective net price will be around $345,000 when factoring in various discounts, the company said, citing the small patient population affected -- or fewer than 3,000 patients currently diagnosed in the U.S. -- among other factors. Alnylam also said it has agreed to agreements with major health insurers in which payment depends on how well Onpattro performs; it expects to make the therapy available to ship to health care providers within two days. Friday's approval marks a milestone for Alnylam as well as the RNAi field, which began about 20 years ago but has been marked by a number of prominent failures. Alnylam was one of few companies that persisted in RNAi development in spite of the field's difficulties, and has described the therapy as a 15-year journey. Company shares surged nearly 52% after positive late-stage trial results for Onpattro; the stock lifted 3.3% in Friday trade before the halt. Shares have declined nearly 1% over the last three months, compared with a nearly 4% rise in the S&P 500

""Our goal is to prevent organizations and individuals from creating accounts that mislead people about who they are or what they're doing,"" Facebook said.

Those viewing the pages will see more details of the people managing the pages in the Info and Ads section.

","Natural Cycles, a mobile phone application that can be used to prevent pregnancy, was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday for direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. The app has been described as ""digital contraception"" by its maker, the privately-held, Sweden-based NaturalCycles Nordic AB. It uses temperature readings from a basal body thermometer to track a woman's menstrual cycle, as minor temperature rises occur around the time of ovulation. The app tells women when they are fertile, and they should avoid sex or use contraception during that time, according to the FDA. That strategy is an old one, sometimes called ""natural family planning"" or ""the rhythm method,"" but Natural Cycles says its special approach, which uses a ""smart algorithm,"" is highly effective. According to the FDA, clinical studies involving about 15,600 women found that when used perfectly, the failure rate - meaning women getting pregnant - was 1.8%, while with typical use, or women sometimes not using the app correctly, the failure rate was 6.5%. Women in the study used the app for an average of eight months. By way of comparison, condoms have a perfect use failure rate of 2% and a typical use failure rate of 18%; for IUDs, typical and perfect use failure rates are all below 1%. The FDA compared Natural Cycles' effectiveness to that of any other contraceptive, with Terri Cornelison, assistant director for the health of women in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, noting that ""no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device."" But a number of alarms have been raised about the app resulting in unintended pregnancies, including in a recent Guardian report whose author reported getting pregnant while using the app. Natural Cycles requires users input temperature data into the app, making it, like other forms of contraception, highly prone to human error. And, importantly, the app cannot warn when ovulation begins early -- and when ovulation occurs in the month is highly unpredictable, according to a Wired report from earlier this year. The FDA says the app shouldn't be used by individuals for whom pregnancy would be a major risk to the mother or fetus, nor by women who are using contraception that inhibits ovulation. Natural Cycles was cleared through a FDA pathway for new types of low-to-moderate risk devices, and controls have been put in place to ""provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness,"" according to the regulator. Other products like Natural Cycles may be able to get the same marketing authorization from the FDA by showing they are substantially similar to it. Natural Cycles was certified as a method of contraception in the European Union last year. ",2018-08-10T14:32:00-04:00,"

","Credit default swaps--the cost to insure debt--on Turkey have spiked on Friday as the country's financial woes spooked global investors. The spread on 5-year credit default swaps on Turkey widened to 450 from 378 on Thursday, according to data from IHS Markit. A CDS spread of 450 means it would cost $450,000 annually to insure $10 million in debt against default for five years. Gavan Nolan, a director at IHS Markit, said Turkey's sovereign debt has been under pressure for some time given the lack of confidence in how President Recep Erdogan's government is handling the economy. The missteps have led to double-digit inflation and an ailing currency. The Turkish lira slumped to a record low against the U.S. dollar with the greenback buying 6.505 lira versus 5.550 in the previous session. ",2018-08-10T13:23:00-04:00,"

Analyst Brian Nagel cut his rating to perform from outperform. Nagel said he still looks ""very favorably"" on Tiffany's longer-term prospects, as a noted activist investor, new senior leadership and an underlying improved backdrop should help drive profitability. ""In the nearer term, we are simply concerned that recent shifts in global currencies could weigh on domestic sales to foreign tourists and knock shares from now peakish valuations,"" Nagel wrote in a note to clients.

                                         took a 3.1% dive in premarket trade Friday, after Goldman Sachs turned bearish on the semiconductor giant, citing competition and margin concerns. Analyst Toshiya Hari cut the rating to sell, after being at neutral for the past 2 1/2 years. Hari lowered the stock price target to $44, which is 12% below Thursday's closing price of $50.14, from $53. Hari said he believes Intel's struggles with 10 nanometer process technology will have ramifications in terms of its competitive position, across a broad set of products, which will affect Intel's ability to sustain margins and grow earnings. ""While the 10nm push is well publicized at this point, we believe Intel's manufacturing issues could potentially be deeper-rooted than what most think and could have a sustained impact on market share and/or spending levels as Intel competes with growing/stronger TSMC eco-system,"" Hari wrote in a note to clients.

                                         rose more than 19% in the extended session Thursday after the company reported a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss and sales came in above forecasts. Puma said it lost $44.3 million, or $1.17 a share, in the second quarter, compared with a net loss of $77.8 million, or $2.10 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales hit $50.8 million. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a loss of $1.26 on sales of $45.7 million. Puma in July got approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Nerlynx, used in the treatment of breast cancer, and the company began shipment to wholesalers at the end of that month. Before the launch of Nerlynx, Puma had no product revenue, as Nerlynx is the company's first and only commercial product to date. Shares had ended the regular session up 0.7%.

The tests are part of Chipotle's effort to be ""more culturally relevant,"" said Chris Brandt, the company's chief marketing officer. There was recently complaints about food-related illnesses in Ohio, and DiCello Levitt & Casey and food safety law firm Ron Simon & Associates filed a lawsuit in Ohio concerning food contamination.

","The commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in a new congressional assessment, concedes that its prior estimate of Hurricane Maria's death toll undershot by a factor of more than 20. It now attributes 1,427 deaths to the September 2017 natural disaster, according to an Associated Press report, having compared deaths recorded in the aftermath of the storm (Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. territory two weeks after Maria) to the average for those same months in a typical year. The prior government estimate of attributable deaths was just 64. During a visit to the island last October, President Trump favorably compared the death count -- then estimated at just 16, according to Gov. Ricardo Rosselló -- to that of a ""real catastrophe"" such as Hurricane Katrina, which is believed to have killed more than 1,800 in U.S. Gulf Coast states in 2005.

","California Rep. Devin Nunes told a gathering of Republican donors last week that the GOP needed to keep control of the House to protect President Donald Trump, and that the conservative bid to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had stalled because it would delay the Senate's possible confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, NBC News reported Wednesday night. MCNBC aired parts of a secret recording made by a member of a progressive group who attended the meeting in Spokane, Wash. In it, Nunes is heard saying: ""If Sessions won't unrecuse and Mueller won't clear the president, we're the only ones. . . Which is really the danger . . . we have to keep all these seats. We have to keep the majority. If we do not keep the majority, all of this goes away."" Nunes also said the problem with impeaching Rosenstein is timing: ""Do you want them to drop everything and not confirm the Supreme Court justice, the new Supreme Court justice?"" Recent polls indicate that Democrats may be poised to win a majority of House seats in the midterm election.",2018-08-08T22:04:00-04:00,"

Buzzfeed said security researcher Ryan Stevenson discovered the flaws, which Comcast said were patched after Buzzfeed alerted them. ""We have no reason to believe these vulnerabilities were ever used against Comcast customers outside of the research described in this report,"" Comcast told Buzzfeed. The vulnerabilities to the cable and internet provider's online customer portal were apparently fairly easy to exploit. A Comcast spokesperson later told MarketWatch that the claim that millions of customers were affected is incorrect. ""In investigating and fixing these issues, we've seen no evidence that they were used against any Comcast customer outside the security researcher who discovered them, much less millions,"" he wrote in emailed comments. Buzzfeed had changed its headline by early Thursday to remove the 26 million reference.",2018-08-09T09:46:00-04:00,"

He set a $3.70 price target on the stock, which closed Wednesday at $3.95. Gee wrote that Zynga is on the ""much-improved trajectory"" but that the company has exhausted many of the ""easy"" avenues for margin expansion, including cuts to titles, studios and its workforce. He's cautious also because it can be difficult to predict whether a new mobile game will succeed and because he believes Zynga will continue to show ""elevated"" marketing growth.

                                         shares dropped 6.5% in Thursday premarket trade after the Ireland-based generic drugmaker reported a second-quarter revenue miss and made cuts to its 2018 guidance. Perrigo said weakness in its prescription drug business drove the results, and separately announced plans to parcel out the unit -- which sells various topical generic products -- from its consumer business. The company is considering options like a business separation, sale or merger, which would likely take place in the second half of next year. The company's board of directors has approved the plan, and Chairman Rolf Classon explained the decision as motivated by ""divergent industry dynamics with unique strategic, financial and operational opportunities and requirements."" Perrigo will provide an update on the consumer businesses on a Sept. 25 conference call. Earnings for the second quarter came to $36 million, or 26 cents per share, compared with a loss of $70 million, or a loss of 49 cents per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $1.22, above the FactSet consensus of $1.19. Results were driven by the company's consumer businesses, while its prescription drug business performed below expectations ""due primarily to a shortfall in new product launches coupled with challenging market dynamics, which is expected to carry forward into the second half of the year,"" Company President and Chief Executive Uwe Roehrhoff said, adding that he is ""extremely disappointed in this development."" Many generic drugmakers have struggled with profitability amid difficult conditions in the U.S., though Perrigo was the rare exception last year. Revenue declined to $1.19 billion from $1.24 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $1.23 billion. Perrigo now expects 2018 revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, a decrease from previous guidance of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. The company also expects 2018 adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.95, below previous expectations of $5.05 to $5.45. Perrigo shares have lifted 6.6% over the last three months, compared with a 5.9% rise in the S&P 500

""NAND is oversupplied and SSD prices are falling (and in some cases pricing is down by as much as 30-40% from the peak per our industry discussions),"" he wrote.

The Federal Communications Commission concluded that Sinclair may have misrepresented or omitted material facts to circumvent ownership rules, Tribune said.

The board confirmed that Musk opened a discussion last week about taking the company private, including discussions about how being private would better serve the company's long-term interests. The board said funding for the proposal was also addressed. On Tuesday, Musk had tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, and that he had secured funding for the deal that would value that company at $72 billion.

                                         has been downgraded from outperform to market perform by Raymond James, as ""we see limited possibilities for further meaningful outperformance given longer-term risks to key portfolio products,"" analyst Elliot Wilbur said in the Wednesday note. Company shares dropped 2.1% in premarket trade, after rising 21% on Tuesday. Though the company's key, and expensive drug, H.P. Acthar Gel, has continued to sell well in spite of barriers put up by health insurers, ""we expect EBITDA levels to drop meaningfully post 2020,"" Wilbur said, due to declines expected for Acthar and other products, and even including expectations for new Mallinckrodt products. Plus, there are concerns about how much the company's pipeline can compensate for sales losses elsewhere, he said. Company shares have surged 138.8% over the last three months to $29.44, compared with a 7% rise in the S&P 500

Revenue rose to $301.1 million from $222.7 million, above the FactSet consensus of $288.6 million, amid strength in sales of its TrueFlex ROADMs, commercial lasers and industrial pump lasers. Lumentum expects first-quarter adjusted EPS of 90 cents to $1.10, compared with the FactSet consensus of 92 cents, and revenue of $340 million to $350 million, which is above expectations of $337.3 million.

The business includes a platform and leadership team, along with 21 full-time employees working on loan origination, underwriting, capital markets and asset management. The loan portfolio, meanwhile, comprises 51 senior loans that are secured by energy infrastructure real assets. Starwood said the portfolio is 97% floating-rate loans, which are attractive in a rising rate environment. The company is expecting the deal to boost core earnings and to close in the third quarter. For GE, the deal is the latest asset sale as it moves to focus on core industrial businesses.

""As surprising to us as these developments are, and as lacking as the statements are in any details regarding who is expected to provide the required amount of financing and on what terms, they are nevertheless declarative statements from the CEO of a public company which we feel should be considered seriously,"" analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note. Musk said he had already secured the funding for a deal, without offering any further detail. Banks and private-equity firms were surprised at that news and questioned how it could be done, given the company is cash flow negative, is loss making and saddled with about $10 billion of debt. ""We continue to believe Tesla's valuation based on fundamentals alone (i.e., a 50/50 blend of discounted cash flow and 2020-based multiples analysis - itself consisting of a blend of P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Price-to-Sales) is worth no more than $195 (our previous price target),"" said Brinkman. ""But introducing a new 50% weighting of $420 suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted, and we newly value Tesla at $308 per share (i.e., 50/50 blend of $195 and $420).""

                                         shares rose 16.3% in Wednesday premarket trade after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue beats and increased 2018 guidance. The company reported a loss of $52.48 million, or a loss of 23 cents per share, after a loss of $696.02 million, or a loss of $3.12 per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were 76 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 54 cents. Revenue declined to $714.7 million from $875.7 million, above the FactSet consensus of $679.7 million. Generic pharmaceutical sales were below the FactSet consensus, while U.S. branded sales and international pharmaceuticals beat the consensus. Chief Executive Paul Campanelli said that although generic pharmaceuticals have ""faced a challenging market environment, we are cautiously optimistic that the portfolio decisions we made over the past 18 months position us well for the future."" Endo now expects 2018 revenue of $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, an increase from previous guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, and 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.50 to $2.60, up from previous guidance of $2.15 to $2.55. Endo also announced on Wednesday a licensing agreement with the privately-held specialty pharmaceutical company Nevakar to develop five sterile injectable products. Endo shares have surged 118.5% over the last three months to $12.65, compared with a 7% rise in the S&P 500

                                         rallied 1.8% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the drugstore chain beat second-quarter profit and sales expectations, boosted by an increase in prescription growth, and raised its outlook. The company swung to a net loss of $2.56 billion, or $2.52 a share, from a profit of $1.10 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as a $3.9 billion goodwill impairment charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.69, above the FactSet consensus of $1.61. Revenue grew 2.2% to $46.71 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $46.32 billion. Same-store sales increased 5.9% to top the FactSet consensus of 5.4% growth, as pharmacy sales rose 8.3% to beat expectations of a 6.6% rise while front-store sales fell 1% to miss expectations of a 2.15 rise. The company said pharmacy same-store sales were boosted by prescription volumes, partially offset by reimbursement pressure and generic introductions.

","On a day when five states held elections, the two most prominent races were too close to call late Tuesday. In a special election for a House seat in Ohio, Republican Troy Balderson held a slim 1,700-vote lead over Democrat Danny O'Connor with all precincts reporting, though some absentee and provisional ballots were still left to be counted. The race was seen as a possible indicator of a ""blue wave"" in the midterm elections, as the district has been solidly Republican for decades and won by President Donald Trump by 11 percentage points in 2016. Even if O'Connor loses, Democrats will likely be encouraged by the narrow margin. In Kansas, Trump-backed Kris Kobach was neck-and-neck with Jeff Colyer in the Republican gubernatorial primary, with about a third of ballots left to be counted. Meanwhile, in Missouri, a Republican ""right to work"" measure was soundly defeated, in a major victory for unions.",2018-08-07T23:21:00-04:00,"

""Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible,"" Musk wrote. He did not spell out how the move would be funded, after his original tweet said ""funding secured,"" but in another tweet after the blog post was published, Musk said, ""Investor support is confirmed."" Tesla stock jumped as much as 8% after his original tweet, before being halted about an hour later. When shares began trading again about 15 minutes before markets were scheduled to close, shares jumped to daily gains of more than 10%.",2018-08-07T15:46:00-04:00,"

                                         rallied toward an 18-month high in afternoon trade Tuesday, to pace the materials sector's gainers, after the fertilizer company beat second-quarter earnings expectations and provided an upbeat outlook. The company said late Monday net income fell to $67.9 million, or 18 cents a share, from $97.3 million, or 28 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes non-recurring items, came to 40 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 38 cents. Revenue rose to $2.21 billion from $1.75 billion, boosted by higher average selling prices, but came in below the FactSet consensus of $2.30 billion, although phosphates and Potash sales rose above expectations. The company raised its 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.45 to $1.80 from $1.20 to $1.60. ""We are seeing positive developments in potash and phosphate markets and we expect the momentum to continue,"" said Chief Executive Joc O'Rourke. He said Mosaic paid down $500 million in debt this year, putting it well ahead of schedule to target $700 million in debt repayment by 2020.

Gross margin improved 1.1 percentage points to 55.3%. The company expects third-quarter revenue of $240 million to $250 million, surrounding the FactSet consensus of $244 million, and reiterated its 2018 revenue growth outlook of ""low single digits."" Separately, CFO Teffner will resign effective April 1, 2019, after 3 1/2 years at the company. In the meantime, Crocs named Anne Mehlman as CFO effective Aug. 24.

The loss was mostly due to an increase in the company's operating loss that was due to an asset impairment associated with the loss of exclusivity of a certain product, an increase in amortization of intangible assets and a decrease in product contribution following divestitures and discontinuations. Revenue fell to $2.128 billion from $2.233 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 80 cents and revenue of $2.063 billion. The company said it realigned into four reporting segments in the quarter, namely Bausch and Lomb/International, its eye treatments; Salix, its gastroenterology business; Ortho Dermatologics; and diversified products. It also made moves to pay down debt, extending the maturity date of its revolving credit facility, replacing Term B loans, modifying facility covenants, lowering interest rates, issuing $750 million of 8.500% unsecured senior notes due 2028 and redeeming about $2 billion of unsecured senior notes.

                                         reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations but revenue that beat, boosted by a doubling in U.S. networks. The stock was still inactive in premarket trade. Net income fell to $216 million, or 30 cents a share, from $374 million, or 64 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 66 cents, while the FactSet consensus was for 83 cents. Revenue rose to $2.85 billion from $1.75 billion. U.S. networks revenue grew to $1.78 billion from $890 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $1.76 billion, while international networks revenue rose 30% to $1.05 billion but was just shy of expectations of $1.07 billion. Excluding transactions, U.S. networks revenue would have declined 1%, as lower program and merchandising sales offset steady distribution and advertising revenue.

The effort, according to the Journal, is aimed at offering additional products in apps such as Messenger that would do things like let people check their checking account balance. Facebook pitched fraud alerts as well, the Journal reported. In a statement Facebook said that the Journal story incorrectly implied ""that we are actively asking financial services companies for financial transaction data - this is not true."" Facebook said that the company partners with banks and credit card companies to offer customer service or account management features within its Messenger software.

Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis downgraded Intel to equal weight from overweight and lowered his target price on the stock to $53 from $62, noting the rating had been difficult to defend. ""Intel continues to believe that it can retain a performance advantage even with a process node disadvantage, but has provided little evidence to support this, creating an overhang well into 2019,"" Curtis said. The analyst is referring to Intel's delayed rollout of chips made from new manufacturing processes versus AMD chips, which are being made with processes that some believe are equal to or better than Intel's. ""We had also hoped a CEO transition would bring in a disruptive external candidate to further focus on costs, but the preliminary list does not appear to be in the direction we had hoped,"" Curits said. Of the 42 analysts that cover Intel, 22 have a buy rating, 16 have a hold rating, and four have a sell rating, along with an average price target of $57.31, according to FactSet. Intel shares are up 5.6% on the year, compared with an 88% gain from AMD shares, a 10.2% rise in the PHLX Semiconductor Index

                                         shares rose 1.5% in heavy Monday morning trade after the company reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue beats. The company reported a loss of $1.2 billion, or a loss of $3.76 per share, after earnings of $274 million, or 86 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The results include an impairment of $1.4 billion largely due to the performance of its Cordis unit, which was acquired by Cardinal Health in 2015 and sells cardiovascular products. The Cordis business has struggled with operational and supply chain issues, but company executives said on a Monday conference call that the unit should become profitable by the end of the 2019 fiscal year. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $1.01, above the FactSet consensus of 93 cents. Revenue rose to $35.35 billion from $32.97 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $34.38 billion. The company's pharmaceutical sales beat the consensus, though profit declined due to generic drug performance, while medical sales missed. Cardinal Health expects 2019 adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5.15, compared with the FactSet consensus of $5.09. Cardinal Health shares have dropped nearly 4% over the last three months, compared with a 6.8% rise in the S&P 500

Regeneron will also invest $100 million in Bluebird Bio shares that values them at $238.10 per share, according to the announcement. Bluebird Bio shares rose 3.5% in morning trade, while Regeneron shares declined 0.3%. The collaboration will focus on six initial targets for the cell therapies, though other targets may also be chosen, and the companies will split the costs of research and development until a new drug application is submitted. The about $37 million premium paid by Regeneron for Bluebird Bio shares will be credited against Regeneron's research funding obligation, after which research will be funded equally. Regeneron will also have the right to choose a co-development and co-commercialization arrangement for certain targets, splitting costs and profits; otherwise, Regeneron will be eligible for milestone payments and royalties. Bluebird Bio shares have dropped nearly 11% over the last three months, while Regeneron shares have surged 35%, compared with a 6.5% rise in the S&P 500

","Toy sales are up 7% to $7.9 billion for the first half of 2018, benefiting from the Toys 'R'Us liquidation, according to the latest data from The NPD Group. ""I am also convinced that the strong toy industry growth so far this year has been at least partially supported by the empathy that people felt towards losing a store like Toys 'R' Us,"" said Juli Lennett, senior vice president and industry advisor for toys at NPD. ""I think it brought about an emotional response that resulted in parents buying more toys overall."" NPD found that toys priced $5 to $19.99 were the strongest growth driver, with toys like LOL Surprise and Hatchimals leading the pack.

""However, after such strong 2Q results, both these concerns fade considerably."" Brendler is now optimistic about Square's ability to keep up its acceleration and continue to post better-than-expected revenue growth through 2020.

The decline was partly due to the movement of certain Spring Hong Kong sales to the first quarter of 2018 that traditionally have been held in the second quarter, the company said in a statement. The schedule change moved $130 million in net auction sales and $20 million in operating income to the first quarter. Revenue rose 2% to $345.6 million from $339.9 million.

He raised his price target on the stock to $80 from $64. Ramsay sees several potential catalysts for the stock, including ""the NXP bid abandoned, a $30 billion buyback program underway, recent $700 million in good faith catch-up payments from a large OEM royalty dispute (we believe Huawei), pending court dates suggesting progress in royalty disputes with Huawei/Apple, and solid progress demonstrated on cost-cutting initiatives.""

The company said it has received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA, saying the data submitted in its new drug application ""do not support the conclusion that the benefits of [REMOXY] Extended-Release Capsules outweigh the risks."" Pain Therapeutics Chief Executive Remi Barbier said it was a ""bizarre conclusion to reach, especially during a time of staggering human and economic toll created by opioid abuse and addiction. We have an innovative drug with a social purpose, and a staggering amount of data that easily supports best-in-class abuse deterrence versus OxyContin. We relied on the criteria of a fair, neutral and impartial regulatory review, as any sponsor would. Instead, I believe REMOXY received an ideological judgement call that is vague in nature but conclusive in its damaging effects."" The company has now initiated a strategic reorganization to be announced shortly that will refocus its efforts on its Alzheimer's disease assets.

""We continued to grow our business in Q3, even with the headwinds we faced related to oversupply and pricing,"" Chief Executive Tom Hayes said in a statement. The company is still expecting fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS of $5.70 to $6.00 and expects sales to grow about 6% to $40 billion to $41 billion.

                                         rallied 3.5% in premarket trade Monday, after the health care services company beat profit and sales expectations and raised its earnings outlook, while announcing restructuring actions that include job cuts and facility closings. Net income rose to $141.2 million, or 92 cents a share, from $136.1 million, or 86 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.04, above the FactSet consensus of $1.01. Revenue grew to $3.33 billion from $3.06 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $3.31 billion, as dental, animal health and medical sales all beat expectations. The company raised its 2018 adjusted EPS outlook to $4.06 to $4.14 from $4.03 to $4.14. Separately, the company said it would record a per-share charge of 22 cents to 27 cents in 2018 as a result of the restructuring.

","China is ready to dig in for a ""protracted"" war with the U.S. over trade, said an editorial over the weekend in China's Global Times newspaper, known for its nationalistic views. The comments in the paper came after China on Friday announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The editorial took specific aim at White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who brushed aside China's latest move as a ""weak response,"" to the U.S.'s planned 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. ""The two numbers, $200 billion and $60 billion, don't show an imbalanced, interdependent economic relationship, but rather that Washington has lost its mind on trade while China retains its rationality. The U.S. is trying to conclude the trade disputes swiftly, but China is prepared for a protracted war,"" the editorial said. President Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that tariffs are ""working big time."" ",2018-08-06T04:20:00-04:00,"

                                         shares dropped 16.3% in extremely heavy Friday morning trade after the company reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss and revenue miss, along with downbeat 2018 guidance. The company said on Thursday after the bell that it had a loss of $166.65 million, or a loss of $3.04 per share, after a loss of $152.06 million, or $2.82 per share in the year-earlier period. The FactSet adjusted earnings-per-share consensus was a loss of $2.63. Revenue rose to $57.21 million from $29.46 million, below the FactSet consensus of $65.5 million. Sales of the ovarian cancer drug Zejula came to $53.89 million, below the FactSet consensus of $54.1 million, while sales of Varubi/Varuby -- intended to prevent the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy treatment -- beat the consensus. Tesaro also reduced its 2018 revenue guidance from between $310 million and $345 million to a range of between $250 million and $265 million, compared with the FactSet consensus of $263.6 million. It now expects 2018 Zejula revenue of $225 million to $235 million, compared with the FactSet consensus of $234.9 million, and a reduction from previous guidance of between $255 million to $275 million. Though the guidance cut for Zejula was expected, RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay said that ""we come away from the quarter concerned about US Zejula sustainability with detail surrounding Zejula's geographic split suggestive of a US Zejula Q/Q decline in Q1:18 which was offset by geographic expansion related to the EU launch."" He added that this dynamic ""could be due to decreased per patient revenue recognition in the US due to toxicity-related dose reductions as physicians gain experience with Zejula,"" which was approved in March 2017; that could in turn affect European sales of the drug too. As a result, the analyst reduced his price target for the company by about 17%, to $38, and maintained a sector perform rating. Company shares have dropped nearly 40% over the last three months, compared with a 7.7% rise in the S&P 500

                                         shares jumped 5.4% in Friday premarket trading after the food company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations. Net income was $756 million, or 62 cents per share, down from $1.16 billion, or 94 cents per share, year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $1.00, beating the 92-cent FactSet consensus. Revenue was $6.69 billion, up from $6.64 last year and ahead of the $6.58 billion FactSet guidance. The company expects to sustain revenue growth from new products that are in the works, marketing and other efforts.

The videogame company reported second-quarter net income of $402 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $243 million, or 32 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items such as share-based compensation, earnings were 62 cents a share. Revenue rose to $1.64 billion from $1.63 billion in the year-ago period but analysts use net bookings, which takes into account physical and digital sales among other things, to determine estimates. Activision reported net bookings fell to $1.38 billion from $1.42 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 35 cents a share on net bookings of $1.38 billion. For the third quarter, analysts model adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share on net bookings of $1.88 billion. The company said it expects third-quarter adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share on net bookings of $1.61 billion. Activision stock gained 1.3% during regular trading and is up 17% this year.

The last time the stock rose at least this much the day after earnings was May 9, 2013, when it soared 24.4% after the electric car maker reported first-quarter 2013 results.

Overall, the average one-day post-earnings move in either direction is 7.1%, while the median move is 6.4%.

                                         shares surged nearly 30% in extremely heavy Thursday trade after the company reported a second-quarter revenue beat and narrower-than-expected loss. Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $30.2 million, or 34 cents per share, after $2.9 million, or 3 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The company said it had an adjusted loss per share of 10 cents, excluding 48 cents per share in income from an investment in Tandem Diabetes Care as well as interest expense on senior convertible notes. The FactSet consensus was a loss of 18 cents per share. Revenue rose to $242.5 million from $170.6 million, above the FactSet consensus of $205.8 million. The company attributed its latest earnings to significant adoption of continuous glucose monitors, which patients use to manage their diabetes more easily. The performance was ""particularly notable"" because the company's G6 platform -- a new iteration of the device that integrates with a smartphone, has a sensor that lasts 10 days and doesn't require a fingerstick test to measure blood sugar levels -- was only launched late in the quarter, Chief Executive Kevin Sayer noted. DexCom also raised its 2018 revenue guidance from a range of $850 million to $860 million to about $925 million. Company shares have lifted 66% over the last three months, compared with a 7.2% rise in the S&P 500

Red Robin expects to report a loss of 14 cents, driven by a 54-cents asset impairment charges, and adjusted earnings of 46 cents. Revenue is expected to total $315.4 million. The FactSet consensus as of July 31 had been for earnings of 65 cents and revenue of $323.6 million. Same-store sales are expected to decrease 2.6%, compared with a FactSet forecast for a 0.6% decline, as of July 31. ""While we remain confident in the strategy that we have in place to address the shifts going on within casual dining, we simply didn't execute as well as we should have,"" said Denny Marie Post, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., chief executive officer. The company has not seen the boost in dine-in traffic to offset the lower check average that is accompanying the Tavern Double Menu, Post said. Service has been impacted by the ""growing complexity of multiple revenue streams"" and the company needs to refresh its marketing and improve its digital experience.

                                         reported Thursday second-quarter earnings and revenue that matched expectations, and affirmed its sales outlook. The natural and organic grocer's stock was still inactive in premarket trade. Net income rose to $41.7 million, or 32 cents a share, from $41.0 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 32 cents. Revenue rose to $1.32 billion from $1.18 billion and same-store sales increased 2.0%, with both matching the FactSet consensus. Direct store expense increased 16% to $273 million, representing a rise to 20.7% of sales from 19.9%, due primarily to planned wage increases resulting from savings from recent tax legislation, as well as increased healthcare costs. The company affirmed its 2018 sales growth outlook of 10.5% to 11.5%, while bumping up its EPS outlook to $1.24 to $1.28 from $1.22 to $1.28. Separately, the company appointed Dave McGlinchey to the new executive role of chief merchandising officer. McGlinchey was previously senior vice president of merchandising services.

TripAdvisor's hotel business performed better than expectations, while its non-hotel business fell short. ""Expectations had risen in recent months, as had optimism around non-hotel growth, so these results will likely be seen as somewhat 'lackluster' by some investors,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson, who raised his price target to $50 from $49 but kept his neutral rating. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill was less upbeat, writing that TripAdvisor ""remains a 'transition' story with a turnaround that gets constantly pushed further into the future.""

Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $466.3 million, or $2.19 per share, from $369.5 million, or $1.71 per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $2.27, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.01. Revenue rose to $2.338 billion from $2.195 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $2.343 billion. The latest results reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange and fuel rates, but ""we are tickled pink that our business continues to excel and overcome these headwinds,"" said Chief Executive Richard Fain. Royal Caribbean continues to expect 2018 adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90 per share, which includes a negative impact of 35 cents connected to currency and fuel and 6 cents in additional interest expense related to the Silversea purchase.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously for the hike.

The maker of high-end speakers had hoped to price shares at $17 to $19 apiece, according to previous filings, but said Wednesday evening that it would instead sell 13.89 million shares at a lower price. At that price, Sonos will bring in at least $208 million at a valuation of nearly $1.5 billion. Underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have access to another 2 million shares, split between Sonos and selling shareholders.

","WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The Federal Reserve voted unamimously to leave a key U.S. interest rate unchanged, but the central bank also signaled more rates hikes are coming by upgrading its view of the economy to ""strong"" from ""solid."" In a statement, the Fed on Wednesday said the economy ""has been rising at a strong rate."" The central bank had used the word ""solid"" in June. The Fed also said both consumer spending and business investment ""have grown strongly."" Inflation, for its part, ""remained near 2%,' the Fed noted after the end of its two-day meeting in Washington. The central bank has previously signaled it would raise rates twice more in 2018 by a quarter-point, with the next one widely expected in September. By the end of 2018 the Fed expects to lift its benchmark rate to an average of 2.4% from the current range of 1.75% to 2%. ",2018-08-01T14:00:00-04:00,"

The company reported a loss of $5.9 million in the latest quarter, or a loss of 7 cents per share, after a loss of $60.0 million, or a loss of 68 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The FactSet adjusted earnings-per-share consensus was a loss of 17 cents. Revenue rose to $96.9 million from $6.3 million, compared with the FactSet consensus of $83.7 million. The revenue beat was made possible by what Chief Executive Kevin Gorman described as the ""continued adoption of Ingrezza by physicians and patients,"" referring to its drug for the rare condition tardive dyskinesia, whichcame to market last year. The company's endometriosis therapy, Orilissa, was also recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

                                         fell about 4% Wednesday, after the company reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that beat estimates, but declined to raise guidance. The company said it had net earnings of $23.8 million, or 39 cents a share, down from $24.9 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 54 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus of 53 cents. Sales rose 5.6% to $392.8 million, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $389 million. Chief Executive Alan Hoskins said the company is benefiting from pricing actions and is on track with the close of its acquisition of the global battery and portable lighting business from Spectrum Brands. It also scaled up its auto care business with the acquisition of Nu Finish. The company said it is sticking with its full-year adjusted EPS forecast of $3.30 to $3.40, which compares with a FactSet consensus of $3.34.

The benchmark note, used to price all manner of debt, including home and car loans, as well as corporate debt, has at times created friction in equity markets, when it rises, because advancing borrowing costs for U.S. corporations can erode revenues. However, a move toward 3% comes after the U.S. economy posted a 4.1% annual rate of expansion for the second quarter and as major companies have booked relatively strong quarterly reports, which may, in theory, help to mute the effects of rising rates.

                                         said Wednesday it has signed renewable energy purchase agreement with Lincoln Clean energy for 60 megawatts of the power produced at the Plum Creek Wind Project in Wayne County, Nebraska. The owner of brands including Folgers, Smucker's and Cafe Bustelo coffee, as well as Dunkin' Donuts, Rachel Ray and Natural Balance, said that from 2020, it expects wind power from Plum Creek to account for about half of its total electricity use. In 2017, electricity accounted for more than half of the company's greenhouse gas emissions. ""This agreement will not only reduce our carbon footprint, but will also allow us to make a lasting contribution to our nation's renewable energy capacity,"" Julia Sabin, vice president of government relations and corporate sustainability said in a statement.

Third Point founder Daniel Loeb has spoken to Campbell's interim CEO Keith McLouglin about possible courses of action for the troubled food company, said the paper. Campbell is currently in the midst of a review of its strategic and operating plans that includes a review of its portfolio of products, which include Prego sauces, Snyder's Lance snacks and Bolthouse Farms.

The net loss widened to $138.5 million, or $1.82 a share, from $30.6 million, or 41 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss was 21 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus for a profit of a penny. Revenue fell 2.5% to $1.11 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.09 billion, as increases in Americas banking and retail revenue offset a decline in Eurasia banking revenue. The company expects 2018 revenue of about $4.5 billion, compared with a previous outlook of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion, and cut its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance range to $280 million to $320 million from $380 million to $410 million.

IDC released the report as Apple executives were discussing fiscal third-quarter earnings, which beat expectations thanks to higher average selling prices for Apple's premium smartphones, even as unit sales came in lower than expected.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected Big 5 to post GAAP and adjusted earnings of 11 cents a share on sales of $247 million in the quarter.

According to a blog post by Facebook head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher, more than 290,000 accounts followed one of the inauthentic Facebook pages tied to the fake accounts; the now-removed accounts also spent roughly $11,000 in Canadian and U.S. dollars on Facebook and Instagram. The ads ran from April 2017 until June of this year. The fake pages created about 30 events from May 2017 until now, the largest of which had 1,400 users interested in attending, the blog post said. Facebook said it wasn't able to definitively say who was responsible for the fake accounts and activity, but said that there were some similarities to the Russian-backed accounts the company has disabled in the past. Facebook stock is up 1.2% to $173.21 in early afternoon trading. Facebook stock has lost about 20% since it reported second-quarter earnings last Wednesday that included a weaker-than-expected outlook for the second half of the year.

Jefferies raised its price target to $550 from $400. Analysts led by Andy Barish say they ""have improved line of sight to mid-single digit same-store sales in '19/'20"" highlighting things like delivery, marketing and operations. ""With more predictable pricing and traffic-driven growth, we believe that restaurant-level margins can begin to expand back toward 20%+ levels,"" analysts wrote. Chipotle shares are down 3.7% in Tuesday trading after media reports of a store closure following food-related illness complaints in Ohio.

The company said it plans to cut costs by 10% to 15% by the end of September, which charges expected to be recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Separately, the company reported a second-quarter net loss that widened to $14.0 million, or 10 cents a share, from $12.4 million, or 9 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss of 5 cents a share matched the FactSet consensus. Revenue rose to $37.8 million from $32.6 million, topping the FactSet consensus of $36.8 million, as 14.5% subscription revenue growth to $34.8 million beat expectations of $33.5 million.

He argued that the stock's risk-reward profile is more balanced following a sharp drop since the company's Friday earnings report. ""We believe the investments aimed at cleaning up the greater platform will prove to be a positive in the long run as it likely leads to a more engaged user base,"" Kelley wrote.

Chief Executive Ian Read said earnings were driven by the growth of key brands including Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz, as well as biosimilars and emerging markets. ""The performance of these growth drivers was partially offset by product losses of exclusivity, a decline in legacy Established Products in developed markets and ongoing legacy Hospira supply shortages,' he said in a statement.

It lowered the midpoint of its full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to reflect the impact of the strong dollar.

The company swung to a net loss of $1.5 million, or 5 cents a share, from a profit of $4.5 million, or 16 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That compared with the average analyst estimate for a profit of 25 cents a share, according to FactSet. Revenue rose 7.6% to $283.5 million, above the FactSet consensus of $281.3 million, as same-store sales growth of 4.7% beat expectations of a 3.0% rise. Gross margin decreased to 35.7% from 37%, as increased costs for transportation and inventory obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix offset favorable revisions to anti-dumping rates. The company affirmed its 2018 outlook.

","There is evidence that North Korea is producing new missiles at the same facility that built intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the U.S., the Washington Post reported late Monday. According to the report, U.S. intelligence agencies, based on satellite photos and other evidence, believe one or two types of new ICBMs are being made at a facility outside Pyongyang. The range of the new missiles was not known, but the move is seen as a sign that North Korea's missile program is not slowing down, despite President Donald Trump's tweet in June that North Korea was ""no longer a Nuclear Threat"" following his summit with Kim Jong Un. Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified on Capitol Hill that North Korea was still secretly producing ""fissile material"" used in nuclear weapons.",2018-07-30T20:32:00-04:00,"

","The U.S. Treasury expects to borrow $329 billion in the July-September quarter, $56 billion more than previously estimated, according to a statement Monday. The new forecast includes an end-of-quarter cash balance of $350 billion. This is the largest borrowing in the third quarter since 2010 and is well above the $189 billion borrowed one year ago. Details of the borrowing will be released Wednesday. One of the reasons for the increased borrowing is that the Fed is not replacing as many securities on its balance sheet once they mature, allowing some to ""roll off"" under its new policy of quantitative tightening. Analysts at Jefferies estimated the government will end up borrowing over one trillion dollars this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. During the April-June quarter, Treasury borrowed $72 billion in net marketable debt and ended with a cash balance of $333 billion. This was slightly lower than the $75 billion estimated. During the October-December quarter, Treasury said it expects to borrow $440 billion in net marketable debt with a cash balance of $390 billion.",2018-07-30T15:21:00-04:00,"

","Gold finished lower Monday, booking a third straight decline, as the precious metal encountered resistance amid rising U.S. government bond yields, even as the dollar softened. December gold, the most-active contract, finished $1.20, or less than 0.1%, lower at $1,231.50 an ounce. The decline marked the third consecutive for the precious metal and came even as the dollar weakened, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index

A weaker dollar usually makes bullion more appealing to buyers using other currencies, and gold tends to rise as stocks, viewed as risky assets, fall. The decline for gold comes a day ahead of a closely watched two-day gathering of the Federal Reserve, which isn't expected to yield major changes to policy, but may underscore the central bank's intent to lift rates twice more in 2018. Higher rates can undercut the appeal of commodities like gold that don't offer a yield.

The stock was also the biggest loser listed on the NYSE. Earlier Monday, the foodservice distributor reported second-quarter net income that rose to $126 million, or 58 cents a share, from $65 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents missed the FactSet consensus of 58 cents. Revenue was flat at $6.16 billion, while total case volume decreased 0.9%. The company said it expects 2018 total case volume to be about the same as last year, compared with previous guidance of 1% growth. Chief Executive Peter Satriano said on the post-earnings conference call with analysts that while he was disappointed with volume, he believes the factors causing this performance are ""transitory in nature.""

                                         shot up 4.4% in morning trade Monday, as analysts continued to give upbeat commentary on the oil and gas company's deal announced last week to sell its Utica shale position for $2 billion. Imperial Capital analyst Jason Wangler said the deal allows for ""meaningful debt repayment,"" a reduction in midstream costs and allows the company to focus on production from the Powder River Basin. Wangler reiterated his in line rating, but his price target of $6 is 30% above current levels. Since Chesapeake announced the deal late Thursday, eight of the 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet have raised their stock price targets, moving that average target up to $4.67 from $4.03 at the end of June. On Friday, the shares had soared as much as 13% intraday before paring gains to close up 0.2%.

The repurchases are part of a $10 billion program authorized in January 2014 that expires at the end of this year. At that point, Caterpillar will start a new $10 billion buyback program, effective Jan. 1, 2019, with no expiration date. Based on Friday's stock closing price of $142.56, the company could repurchase about 8.8 million shares, or roughly 1.5% of the shares outstanding, through the end of 2018. With the expected second-half purchases, Caterpillar will have spent about $7 billion of the $10 billion program.

The ""black ops"" campaigns against the U.S. and Australia, the Sunday Times reported, included a demonstration against Australia's hosting bid at a rugby match and an effort to organize American gym teachers to oppose the U.S. bid on the grounds that funds could be better used on youth sports. The effort also featured a recruitment of influential people to mount public opposition to the countries' bids and the funding of an academic study intended to show exorbitant costs associated with the U.S.'s securing hosting honors. The U.S. has subsequently seen its joint bid with Mexico and Canada to host the event in 2026 selected.",2018-07-30T08:34:00-04:00,"

","More than 500 hikers from France, Germany, the U.S., the Netherlands and Thailand, among other countries, are trapped on a mountain in Indonesia, after an earthquake started a landslide that has blocked their way down, according to media reports on Monday. A 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday, trapping hikers on Mount Rinjani, an active volcano that is the second-tallest in Indonesia, according to Sky News, and a popular tourist destination for its breathtaking views. A full 800 people had registered to climb the mountain on Sunday, and about 300 made it back down before the earthquake hit, said reports. Helicopters were dropping supplies to the hikers, none of whom were reported to be injured. Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Lombok on Monday to visit victims. ""We must be aware that our country is in the Ring of Fire, so people need to be prepared to face any disaster,"" he said, according to Sky. The Ring of Fire is the name of an area in the Pacific that is home to many active earthquakes and volcanic activity. ",2018-07-30T08:30:00-04:00,"

RLJ Entertainment serves audiences primarily through its over-the-top channels, such as Acorn TV, which offers British programming. Shares of AMC Networks have gained 9.3% so far this year, while RLJ shares have shot up 32.4%.

                                         shares sank 6.5% in Monday premarket trading after the company issued a profit warning for fiscal 2018, driven by uncertain trade policies and higher tariffs that impact domestic and export prices on items like chicken and pork. Tyson Foods brands include Ball Park and Jimmy Dean in addition to the namesake chicken products. The company now expects adjusted fiscal-year earnings of $5.70 to $6.00 per share, down from $6.55 to $6.70 per share. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $6.55. Other drivers include commodity market volatility, ""sluggish"" domestic chicken demand, and compressed pork margins. ""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" said Tyson Chief Executive Tom Hayes in a statement. Tyson is off to a slow fourth-quarter start as a result of these market factors, he said. Tyson will report fiscal third-quarter results on August 6.

                                         surged 3.2% in premarket trade Monday, after the machinery maker reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and raised its full-year outlook. Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $2.82 a share, from $802 million, or $1.35 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.97, above the FactSet consensus of $2.75. The company expects the recently imposed tariffs to impact materials costs by $100 million to $200 million in the second half of 2018, while supply chain challenges are expected to keep pressuring freight costs. Caterpillar plans to offset these costs with price increases. Revenue grew to $14.01 billion from $11.33 billion, matching the FactSet consensus. Of Caterpillar's largest business segments, construction industries revenue rose 24% to $6.17 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $6.01 billion and energy and transportation revenue increased 20% to $5.72 billion to beat expectations of $4.95 billion. The company raised its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $11.00 to $12.00 from $10.25 to $11.25, compared with the FactSet consensus of $10.76.

","WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - U.S. economic growth accelerated to an annual rate of 4.1% in the second quarter, compared with a revised 2.2% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. This is the fastest rate of growth in almost four years. The second quarter gain was close to the 4.2% rate economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast. The acceleration of real gross domestic product in the second quarter reflected a jump in consumer and government spending. The trade sector boosted GDP but this was offset by a downturn in inventory investment. Real final sales for domestic purchasers, which excludes trade and inventories, rose 3.9% in the second quarter after a 1.9% gain in the prior quarter. ",2018-07-27T08:30:00-04:00,"

                                         dropped 1.2% toward a near 4-year low in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker beat second-quarter profit expectations but sales came up a bit shy, and gave a downbeat outlook. Net income rose to $157 million, or 65 cents a share, from $147 million, or 58 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 62 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 59 cents. Revenue grew 4% to $3.84 billion from $3.69 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.85 billion. Tire unit volume increased 4% to 39.0 million. The company cut its 2018 segment operating income guidance range to $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion from the $1.8 billion-to-$1.9 billion range provided in April, citing expectations that raw materials costs will increase $130 million in the second half of the year, a $60 million unfavorable swing in foreign currency translation resulting from a strong U.S. dollar and a $70 million headwind from ""softening"" market conditions in China.

Morgan analyst Sterling Auty downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight following the earnings report. ""The issues in the collaboration segment of the business, the largest portion of revenue at 57%, are causing management to lower the full-year outlook and likely will place the stock in the penalty box as changes will take a couple of quarters to get worked out,"" he wrote. ""LogMeIn's valuation on a cash flow basis appears to be a sizable discount, but investors will likely question the ability to deliver the results in the near-term keeping a lid on shares, especially given management commentary about competition and prices."" Auty also discussed competitive pressures, which he said will remain a concern for investors until the company sees improvement in its collaboration business.

                                         shares fell 1.4% in premarket trade Friday, after the consumer goods giant posted weaker-than-expected sales for the second quarter. The company said it had net income of $637 million, or 73 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $524 million, or 59 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 77 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Sales rose to $3.886 billion from $3.826 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $3.916 billion. ""The second quarter was another challenging one with category growth rates remaining soft in many markets around the world and recent unfavorable movements in foreign exchange,"" Chief Executive Ian Cook said in a statement. ""Net sales grew 1.5% and organic sales grew 0.5%, below our expectations, due to unit volume declines in emerging markets and flat pricing worldwide."" The company is now expecting a low-single-digit net sales increase in 2018 and double-digit growth in EPS.

Sources told CNN that Cohen was willing to confirm as much to special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump has repeatedly denied knowing about the meeting, but sources reportedly told CNN that Cohen was in the room with Trump when he was told about it, and approved the meeting ahead of time.

","The Chinese economy is at a ""historic juncture"" having to move from ""high speed"" growth to ""high quality"" growth, and how this shift is carried through will determine the country's development path for decades to come, the staff of the International Monetary Fund said in a report released Thursday. There are tensions in the government's strategy between, on the one hand, allowing market forces a decisive role and the pervasive role of the state, the report said. Relatively restrictive trade-and-investment regime in some areas and still unsustainable debt growth are other key challenges. To succeed, China must rein in credit growth, increase the role of market forces, and foster openness, the staff said. The risks are to the downside, including from the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. ",2018-07-26T18:06:00-04:00,"

                                         has decided to stop competing with Slack and team up with the software startup, selling intellectual property for its competing software offerings to Slack and investing in the company. Atlassian shares jumped more than 16% in after-hours trading to prices that would easily top record highs in regular trading. Atlassian launched a new Slack competitor called Stride last year, and already had another messaging program called Hipchat. Those services will be discontinued, and customers will be migrated to Slack, Atlassian said in its announcement. ""We are excited to join forces with Slack to target the immense markets for team collaboration and communications,"" Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian co-CEO and co-founder, said in Thursday's news release. Atlassian also reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, reporting adjusted earnings of 13 cents a share on sales of $243.8 million against average analyst expectations of 12 cents a share on revenue of $233.4 million, according to FactSet. Atlassian shares rose more than 16% in late trading after closing with a 0.3% decline at $66.83; shares have never traded for more than $68.98 in a regular session, but were going for more than $77 in after-hours action.

The story of the day, however, was Facebook's historic slide as investors responded to disappointing guidance from the social-media giant during its earnings update, pointing to expectations for lower ad revenue in the wake of its Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook's decline marked its worst since it became a public company on May 18, 2012 and cut about $120 billion in value from its market capitalization, the steepest loss from a U.S. public company since Intel Corp.

Because most stock indexes are market-cap weighted, Facebook's powerful drop weighed mightily on the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader market, which tends to be market-cap pegged.

","The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is examining tweets from President Donald Trump about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the former FBI director James Comey to see if they played a part in attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation, according to the New York Times on Thursday. The report, which cites three people briefed on the matter, said Mueller wants to question the president about the tweets.

Shares of Symantec were up 0.4% at $20.77 on Thursday. Noted cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs reported late Wednesday that LifeLock just fixed a bug on its site that would allow hackers to fool LifeLock customers in phishing attempts. Krebs said Symantec took the site offline shortly after he contacted the company. A spokesperson for Symantec clarified to MarketWatch that LifeLock's site was not taken offline but a ""marketing opt-out page"" had been taken down. In late 2016, Symantec said it would buy Lifelock for $2.3 billion, and the deal was closed in February 2017. ",2018-07-26T11:42:00-04:00,"

Earnings for the latest quarter came to a loss of $138 million, or a loss of 68 cents per share, after earnings of $309 million, or $1.45 per share in the year-earlier period. The company said it took a pre-tax and after-tax charge of $570 million, or $2.81 per share, related to new United Kingdom government reimbursement reductions announced in late June and changes to McKesson's business structure. Adjusted earning-per-share were $2.90, above the FactSet consensus of $2.89. Revenue rose to $52.61 billion from $51.1 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $52.89 billion. McKesson is ""disappointed by the recent government-initiated reimbursement cuts in the U.K. These incremental cuts create ongoing challenges in our U.K. retail pharmacy business,"" said Chief Executive John Hammergren. McKesson expects 2019 adjusted EPS of $13 to $13.80, compared with the FactSet consensus of $13.42.

The central bank kept rates unchanged, as expected, emphasizing that it was holding to a plan laid out in June to unwind its asset purchases, but wouldn't move to commence tightening policy until next summer. ECB President Mario Draghi, at an 8:30 a.m. news conference, said the eurozone economy was proceeding on a ""solid, broad-based"" growth path, but that risks surrounding global themes such as trade remained ""prominent"". Draghi will be watched closely on forecasts on economic growth in the second half of the year as well as comments on trade and currency strength will be in focus.

","The European Central Bank on Thursday, as expected, left interest rates unchanged and affirmed its plan to end its monthly bond-buying program in December. The ECB's key lending rate remains at 0%, while the rate paid on deposits parked overnight at the central bank remains at negative 0.4%. The ECB also repeated that it plans to keep rates at present levels ""at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.""

                                         reported a second-quarter profit that missed expectations, and said it was setting a new direction with return to its roots as a technology company. Net income declined to $112 million, or 42 cents a share, from $166 million, or 63 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 83 cents. Revenue fell to $2.51 billion from $2.57 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $2.49 billion. Chief Executive John Visentin, who has been in the role for two months, said the fact that its business model is underpinned by an annuity cash flow makes it challenging to improve revenue and flow cost savings to the bottom line. Vistentin said the company will take action to improve effectiveness and efficiency of its supply chain and go-to-market channels. Separately, Xerox authorized a $1 billion share buyback program, with $500 million of repurchases expected in 2018.

Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $800 million, or $2.78 per share, from $553 million, or $1.89 per share in the year-earlier period. The FactSet adjusted earnings-per-share consensus was $2.34. Raytheon said that EPS results reflect lower taxes, as a result of the new U.S. tax law, and a pension contribution the company plans to make, which had a favorable tax-related EPS lift of 33 cents. Revenue rose to $6.63 billion from $6.28 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $6.51 billion.

Raytheon also expects 2018 EPS of $9.77 to $9.97, compared with previous guidance of $9.70 to $9.90 and the FactSet consensus of $9.90. The new guidance reflects the company's pension plan contribution as well as an unfavorable charge due to a a group annuity contract intended to transfer outstanding pension benefit obligations for certain individuals.

The company reported a net loss that narrowed to $472.5 million, or $1.39 a share, from $795.5 million, or $2.37 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as the impact of amortization and impairments, adjusted earnings per share came to $4.42, above the FactSet consensus of $4.13. Revenue rose to $4.12 billion from $4.01 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $3.92 billion, as 6.5% growth in U.S. specialized therapeutics sales to $1.83 billion beat expectations of $1.62 billion. Allergan raised its 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range to $16.00 to $16.50 from $15.65 to $16.25, which is well above the FactSet consensus of $15.31. Separately, the company said it expects to deploy to new $2 billion share repurchase program, which follows the completion of the $2 billion program announced in September 2017, over the next 12 months.

Videos on social media showed emergency officials on the scene and smoke in the area, which also houses a number of other embassies, including India's. There were no immediate details of the cause of the apparent blast, or whether there are casualties. According to reports by Reuters and the Associated Press, Chinese state media said police had stopped a woman who doused herself in gasoline in an apparent self-immolation attempt in front of the embassy shortly before the incident, but that could not be independently verified. The incident happened around 1 p.m. local time.

The move by the House Freedom Caucus leaders is not seen as a sign that the full House will soon vote to impeach, as it appears to lack support from some Republican leaders. It also comes just a day before the House leaves for a monthlong recess.

Shares were down about 7% before the conference call, when Chief Financial Officer David Wehner disclosed the social-media giant expects a revenue deceleration to continue. ""Our total revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue growth rates to decline by high single digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4,"" he said on the conference call.

                                         fell more than 3% late Wednesday after the auto maker missed quarterly expectations and lowered its profit guidance for the year, saying it was ""a particularly challenging quarter for Asia Pacific and Europe,"" and vowed to focus on China and take ""urgent action to address underperformance."" Ford earned $1.1 billion, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.05 billion, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales fell $1 billion to $38.9 billion in the quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected GAAP and adjusted earnings of 31 cents a share on sales of $39.2 billion for the quarter. Results in North America were ""solid,"" with sales of F-Series pickup trucks on track for a record through the first six months of the year, Ford said. That performance was offset by ""unexpected challenges with our overseas operations and headwinds in the business environment,"" Chief Executive Jim Hackett said in a statement. ""Despite this, our fitness actions continue to take hold and we're clearly committed to redesigning and restructuring the underperforming parts of our business,"" he said. Ford is making the ""hard decisions"" it needs on certain items, and will sell what it can't turn around, the company said. It lowered the range for full-year 2018 adjusted earnings to $1.30-$1.50 a share. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect adjusted EPS of $1.51 for the year.",2018-07-25T16:37:00-04:00,"

                                         tumbled more than 17% Wednesday, after the company said an appeals court has denied its motion on patents for its multiple sclerosis treatment Ampyra. The company had filed for an injunction pending a decision in its appeal of a U.S. District Court decision from 20717 in patent litigation with generic drug makers. That court upheld a patent that is set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidated four others that would have allowed it to retain exclusivity until 2027. ""If the Court of Appeals does not overturn the District Court's decision by July 30, 2018, multiple generic drug manufacturers may decide to launch at-risk generic versions of Ampyra,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. Ampyra chalked up net sales of $103 million in the first quarter and the company backed 2018 guidance of $330-$350 million. In 2017, the drug accounted for more than half of all sales.

The Wednesday event, detailing phase 2 trial results for the Alzheimer's disease therapy BAN2401, could position Biogen as a leader in the difficult-to-treat disease, with two promising Alzheimer's disease therapies. The release has also become the subject of Wall Street buzz because many of Biogen's other important clinical trials, including for its other Alzheimer's disease therapy, aducanumab, won't put out new results for another year or so. Biogen and partner Eisai [s:jp:4523] have already said that the phase 2 trial had positive results. But depending on whether the full data are better or worse than expected, the stock could either move up $40 or down $20, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Biogen shares also rose 4.1% in Tuesday trade after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue beats and upbeat 2018 guidance. Biogen shares have surged 41% over the last three months, compared with a 6.9% rise in the S&P 500

Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $1.49 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $1.38 billion, or $1.58 per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $1.94, above the FactSet consensus of $1.93. Adjusted EPS results excluded an after-tax charge of 23 cents per share largely related to a voluntary early retirement program that is part of the company's cost-cutting plan. Revenue rose to $17.46 billion from $15.93 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $17.33 billion. Of the company's business segments, U.S. domestic sales missed the FactSet consensus, while revenue for the international segment and the supply chain and freight segment beat the consensus. UPS said that in the U.S. domestic segment, higher base-rates and fuel surcharges offset headwinds from customer and product mix. UPS still expects 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.03 to $7.37, compared with the FactSet consensus of $7.25. UPS shares have lifted 3.5% over the last three months, compared with a 6.9% rise in the S&P 500

                                         shares soared more than 15% higher in after-hours trading Tuesday after the company reported better earnings than expected and raised its full-year forecast. The maker of Roomba and other domestic robots reported second-quarter net income of $10.5 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $226.3 million, up from earnings of 27 cents a share on revenue of $183.4 million a year ago. Analysts on average expected profit of 18 cents a share on sales of $220 million. Chief Executive Colin Angle cited the outperformance and outlook for more in raising the company's full-year forecast Tuesday: iRobot now expects 2018 earnings of $2.30 to $2.50 a share on revenue of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion. Previously, the company had provided guidance of $2.15 to $2.40 a share on sales of $1.05 billion to $1.08 billion. iRobot stock clocked huge gains last year, but has fallen back in 2018, declining 7.2% so far this year as the S&P 500 index

""We believe this is an important step that will facilitate our access to capital over the next several years and enable us to implement our growth plans for MoviePass, MoviePass Films and MoviePass Ventures,"" said Ted Farnsworth, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of HMNY. Analysts see the split as a way to bolster the company's shares, which are currently trading at 9 cents. If a stock trades below $1 for 30 consecutive days, it is in danger of being delisted, according to Nasdaq rules. The company has burned through its cash holdings, disclosing in an April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its average cash deficit was $21.7 million a month from September 2017 to April 2018.

                                         bonds were slightly higher Tuesday, a day after a sharp selloff triggered by concerns raised by a report that suggested the company was trying to wring concessions from suppliers. The 5.300% notes that mature in August of 2025 were trading at 89.50 cents on the dollar to yield 7.225%, or at a yield spread of 427 basis points over Treasurys. The notes fell more than 2 points at their worst levels on Monday. The Wall Street Journal said that Tesla had asked some suppliers to rebate payments going back to 2016, but Tesla said that it asked fewer than 10 suppliers for reductions in total capital expenditure spending on projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete. The company is focused on reaching a ""more sustainable"" long-term cost basis with suppliers, including pushing for future cost reductions, a spokesman told MarketWatch in emailed comments.

","Billy McFarland, the founder of the failed venture Fyre Festival that sought to host a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" music festival in the Bahamas, has admitted the Securities and Exchange Commission allegations against him, agreed to a permanent officer-and-director bar, and agreed to disgorgement of $27.4 million. That is deemed satisfied by the forfeiture order entered in McFarland's sentencing in a related criminal case. The chief marketing officer, Grant Margolin, and independent contractor, Daniel Simon, agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the charges, as did the Fyre Media Inc. and Magnises Inc. Margolin has agreed to a 7-year director-and-officer bar and must pay a $35,000 penalty, and Simon has agreed to a 3-year director-and-officer bar and must pay over $15,000 in disgorgement and penalty.

""The bottom line is that after two disappointing quarters, we have less conviction that ITW can deliver differentiated margin/EPS growth over the next 12 months,"" analysts led by Joe Ritchie wrote in a note. Goldman was buy-rated on the stock based on strong execution and a differentiated margin story, which it expected would lead to beats on earnings estimates. The company has outperformed margin expectations for at least the last five years, as it streamlined its portfolio. ""After two quarters of missed expectations, our conviction has waned,"" said the note. ""Specifically, we under-appreciated the margin headwinds associated with price/cost. Additionally, the company called out growth investments (60bps) for the first time, highlighting that margins could remain pressured for the near-to-medium term.""

""The establishment of our first European production hub will create new opportunities for Spain's incredible creative talent, as well as demonstrating our commitment to the production of original content throughout Europe,"" said Erik Barmack, vice president of international originals at Netflix, in a statement. The company has several Spanish titles in production, such as ""Elisa & Marcela"" and ""The Alcásser Murders,"" and will soon release season 3 of ""Las Chicas del Cable"" and young adult drama ""Élite.""

Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $1.86 billion, or $3.07 per share, from $1.58 billion, or $2.58 per share in the year-earlier period. 3M said it recorded a benefit of 48 cents per share because of its communications markets business divestiture. The FactSet adjusted EPS consensus was $2.58. Revenue rose to $8.39 billion from $7.81 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $8.38 billion. 3M raised its 2018 EPS guidance from $8.68 to $9.03 to $9.08 to $9.38, to reflect the impact of its communication markets business divestiture and other actions. The new 2018 EPS guidance comes in above the FactSet consensus of $8.78.

                                         shares fell 2.6% in Tuesday premarket trading after the consumer products company reported second-quarter revenue that missed expectations and issued a profit warning. Kimberly-Clark brands include Kleenex, Huggies diapers, and Cottonelle. Net income totaled $455.0 million, or $1.30 per share, down from $531.0 million, or $1.49 per share, for the same period last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.59. Sales totaled $4.60 billion, edging up from $4.58 billion last year. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.57 and sales of $4.62 billion. The results ""reflect a challenging environment, particularly with commodity inflation,"" said Chief Executive Thomas Falk in a statement. Higher commodity costs were also the reason the company lowered its earnings guidance. Kimberly-Clark now expects EPS of $6.60 to $6.80 versus prior guidance for $6.90 to $7.20. The company expects net sales to be breakeven to up 1% versus the prior assumption for an increase of 2% to 3%.

                                         shares rose 1.6% in Tuesday premarket trade after the company reported positive results from a phase 3 cancer trial after-hours the previous day. The trial evaluated Celgene's chemotherapy drug Revlimid along with the cancer drug rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma, finding that the two drugs led to a highly statistically significant improvement in the trial's primary endpoint, progression-free survival, as compared with rituximab plus the placebo. Celgene also said that a ""favorable trend"" was seen when it came to overall survival, though ""follow-up will continue for the mature [overall survival] results."" The company will submit data from the trial at a future medical meeting, and plans to prepare global regulatory submissions in the first quarter of next year. Many of Celgene's largest drugs are expected to lose patent protection, but Celgene has struggled to get other products approved. ""Celgene's stock has been plagued by the triple threats of poor investment decisions, weak operational performance and long term patent uncertainty, and as a result has been one of the worst performing stocks in the large cap biotech group over the last 3, 6, and 12 months,"" said Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges. ""Something had to go right... Despite recent history, not everything in the company's portfolio will fail, nor every operational result disappoint.""

Whirlpool said it lost $657 million, or $9.50 a share, in the quarter, versus earnings of $189 million, or $2.52 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, Whirlpool earned $3.20 a share, compared with $3.35 a share a year ago. Sales fell to $5.1 billion, from $5.3 billion a year ago. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $3.43 a share on sales of $5.3 billion. Whirlpool said it expects GAAP per-share earnings between 15 cents and 75 cents in 2018 and adjusted 2018 per-share earnings between $14.20 and $14.80 a share ""as favorable product price/mix and share repurchases are expected to be more than offset by lower global revenue growth, increased expectations for global cost inflation, and weaker than expected performance in the EMEA region,"" it said in a statement. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect per-share adjusted earnings of $15.64 for the year. As a result of below-expectations performance in EMEA, ""we are taking strong actions to improve our operational execution, and remain confident that we will deliver value for our shareholders in the coming quarters,"" Chief Executive Marc Bitzer said in a statement.

The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter, which works out to $4.54 a share, down from $5.01 a share a year ago, when the company also dealt with a big antitrust fine out of the EU. Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts' average estimate of $9.64 a share, according to FactSet. Alphabet reported revenue after accounting for traffic-acquisition costs of $26.24 billion, up from $20.91 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and higher than the average analyst estimate of $25.58 billion. Alphabet shares jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading Monday to prices higher than its intraday record of $1,221.59, following a 1.1% gain in regular trading to $1,211.

She sees the potential for earnings upside driven by the secular shift toward over-the-top TV viewing, connected TVs, and the company's ad-supported ""Roku Channel."" She's upbeat about the company's ad business, given that it doesn't have text ads or programmatic ads, which allows it to command ""premium CPMs"" of between $30 and $100. Martin wrote that Roku also benefits from new entrants to the streaming space, because it gets a cut of revenue when consumers sign up for additional services, like Walt Disney Co.'s

                                         shot up 7% in premarket trade Monday, after the toymaker reported second-quarter profit and revenue beat expectations by wide margins. Net income fell to $60.3 million, or 48 cents a share, from $67.7 million, or 54 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 29 cents a share. Revenue declined to $904.5 million from $972.5 million, but was well above the FactSet consensus of $839.3 million, as better-than-expected franchise brands and Hasbro gaming sales offset a miss in partner brands. ""2018 is unfolding as expected as our teams manage the liquidation of Toys 'R' Us in many markets and address the rapidly evolving European retail landscape,"" said Chief Executive Brian Goldner.

The president's comments came a day after he criticized the Federal Reserve for hiking rates, which he described as undercutting his recent rounds of fiscal stimulus, including corporate tax cuts late last year. On Thursday, Trump told CNBC he is not ""thrilled"" that the Fed is hiking interest rates. ""Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really - I am not happy about it. But at the same time, I'm letting them do what they feel is best."" He added, ""but I don't like all of this work that goes into doing what we're doing.""

","President Donald Trump said he could escalate his trade clash with China by placing tariffs on some $505 billion in Chinese products, representing the entire import balance with the U.S. last year. Trump made his comments during a CNBC interview on Thursday, which aired in full Friday morning. ""I'm ready to go to 500,"" Trump said. Most recently, the U.S. and China enacted reciprocal tariffs of 25% on $34 billion in their respective imports. Although trending higher recently, the stock market has been roiled by concerns that a trade war erupting between to the two superpowers could rattle global economies.

                                         shares jumped to a 4% gain in after-hours trading Thursday after the tech giant supplied its forecast for the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year. Shares had been up 1% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report showed stronger-than-expected profit and sales. Microsoft provided revenue guidance for its different segments on the conference call, predicting $9.25 billion to $9.45 billion for ""Productivity and Business Processes""; $8.15 billion to $8.35 billion for ""Intelligent Cloud""; and $9.95 billion to $10.25 billion in ""More Personal Computing."" In total, that suggests first-quarter revenue of $27.35 billion to $28.05 billion. Analysts on average were projecting revenue of $27.4 billion, according to FactSet. Microsoft did not give an earnings projection nor a full-year forecast, though Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said cost of goods sold in the first quarter was expected to be $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, operating expenses would be $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion, and income and expense is expected to be about $100 million to the negative side.",2018-07-19T18:18:00-04:00,"

The beleaguered floral company said John Walden had stepped down as president and CEO effective immediately and would be replaced on an interim basis by General Counsel Scott Levin. The company also said it would eliminate the COO position, previously held by Simha Kumar, and that CMO Jeffrey Severts would leave the company. In addition to Levin, Chief Information Officer Jay Topper will remain with a new title of chief digital officer. The company said that it had hired Moelis & Co. to assist with a strategic review that will include the possibility of ""a sale or merger of the company."" In addition, the company said it was restructuring in an effort to save $18 million to $23 million in annualized costs in 2019, though it did not say how many employees would be let go. FTD said it expects to report second-quarter net income of $1.5 million to $4.5 million on revenue of $299 million to $301 million, well below the average analyst estimate of $11 million in profit and $320 million in sales, according to FactSet. The company also reduced its forecast for annual 2018 profit and revenue. FTD stock dropped 17% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

                                         said Thursday afternoon that it plans to acquire gene-therapy startup Agilis Biotherapeutics for $200 million plus incentives, and shares spiked higher. PTC said the five-year-old company has a promising biologics candidate that seeks to treat Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, a rare disorder of the central nervous system. ""Based on multiyear data from initial clinical studies with the AADC gene therapy treatment candidate, PTC plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA in 2019,"" the company stated. Agilis has other gene-therapy candidates focused on rare diseases as well, PTC claimed. PTC has agreed to pay $50 million in cash and $150 million in stock for Agilis, with an estimated maximum limit of 9.34 million shares; if that share count doesn't meet the $150 million target, the rest will be made up in cash. The company also promised $60 million in development milestones over the next two years, with one of the conditions being the FDA's acceptance of the BLA, as well as up to $685 million in success-based and commercial milestone incentives. PTC expects the deal to close in the third quarter, and the boards of both companies have approved the transaction. PTC stock was halted before the announcement, and jumped 15% in after-hours trading after the halt was lifted, though gains settled closer to 10% later in extended trading.

Trump nominated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to his current post, replacing Janet Yellen. It is unusual for an acting U.S. president to criticize the actions of the central bank, which is considered an independent entity. Trump's gripe appears to be that fiscal-policies enacted in late 2017, including corporate tax cuts, are being undone by rate hikes, which can raise borrowing costs for companies and consumers, since the Fed's actions help set the rates for everything from mortgages and car loans to corporate debt. The Fed's strategy, started before Powell, is to remove ultralow monetary policy that has been accommodative to growth and put in place to avert a deep collapse of the global market wrought by toxic asset-backed securities. Now, the Fed fears inflated asset prices unnatural as the economy has shown marked signs of health more than a decade after the financial crisis took hold. The Fed has struggled to balance returning to normal while not disrupting the economy's expansion. Trump told Kernen that he's letting the Fed do what it sees fit but ""at the same time,""he said, ""I don't like all of this work that's going in to this economy,"" while rates keep going up.

His new rating is based on his expectation that Model S and Model X sales will slow given competitive pressures, the expiration of tax credits, and potential cannibalization from the Model 3.

A Tesla spokesman said that the idea that Model 3 cancellations were rising faster than new orders was false, as were Gill's arguments about wait times.

","The U.S. dollar turned negative versus its main rivals on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he disagreed with the Federal Reserve's strategy to gradually hike interest rates. Trump told CNBC during an interview on Thursday that he isn't ""thrilled"" that the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates. An excerpt of the the interview, which is slated to air early Friday, was released midday Thursday. ""Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really - I am not happy about it,"" Trump said. The Federal Reserve has so far raised interest rates seven times since the end of 2015, with up to two more rate hikes expected in 2018. The monetary tightening guided both the dollar, as well as U.S. Treasury yields higher. Trump's comments are uncomfortable to investors as it called the Fed's independence from the government into question. Trump himself had nominated current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who took office earlier this year.

","A policy being weighed by the Trump administration that could threaten drug price rebates, a widespread feature of the U.S. pharmaceutical system that largely benefits pharmaceutical middlemen, sent shares of those companies down in Thursday trade. Those middlemen, called pharmacy-benefit managers, negotiate rebates with drugmakers on behalf of health plans and employers so that patients are able to take those drugs. But the system has been increasingly criticized for helping to drive drug prices up. The Trump administration is considering getting rid of the legal protection that rebates have, which could harm pharmacy-benefit managers. But any changes would take at least two years, according to a Height Securities note, and could even come with an expanded drug price negotiation role for the middlemen. That didn't stop pharmacy-benefit manager shares from dropping on Thursday, with Express Scripts Holding Co.

                                         shares dropped 5.5% in heavy Thursday morning trade after short seller Citron Research described the company as ""the next great drug short"" in a tweet and said it planned to release reports about the company. The Citron tweet came the day after Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb put out a plan to encourage the development and uptake of lower-priced biosimilar drugs, accusing large drugmakers in a speech of stymying the competition. Those remarks, along with a proposed policy that could endanger drug rebates -- a widespread, longtime feature of the U.S. pharmaceutical pricing system -- are ""a DIRECT hit on Abbvie's abuse of Humira,"" Citron said in the tweet, referring to the company's anti-inflammatory therapy. Humira is the world's top-selling drug and, as a result, has been a top target for biosimilar copycats. The short seller also predicted that AbbVie shares, which closed at $94.40 on Wednesday, would drop to $60. On Wednesday, Gottlieb spoke of pharmaceutical companies that dangle ""big rebates to lock up payers in multiyear contracts right on the eve of biosimilar entry."" Notably, though, other companies have also been accused of levying contractual negotiations to prevent the uptake of biosimilars, including Johnson & Johnson

                                         said early Thursday that, after the company reported a patient death in its cancer drug trial, the Food and Drug Administration placed the trial on a partial clinical hold. The patient death could be related to Mersana Therapeutics' drug, XMT-1522. Company shares plummeted 43.8% in premarket trade. Under the partial hold, no new patients will be enrolled in the phase 1 trial, though the trial -- which is testing the drug in individuals with breast, gastric and non-small cell lung cancers -- will continue on for patients who are already participating, the company said. Mersana shares were halted in premarket trade. XMT-1522 is the furthest-along product in Mersana's pipeline. The partial clinical hold will not affect the development of Mersana's other therapy, XMT-1536, the company said, which is also in early-stage clinical trials.

                                         soared 6.3% toward a record high in premarket trade Thursday, after the science and technology company said it plans to spin off its dental business into an independent, publicly traded company, and reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The company said the spin off is expected to be tax free to Danaher shareholders and to be completed in the second half of 2019. Separately, the company reported second-quarter net earnings that rose 20% from a year ago to $673.8 million, or 95 cents a share. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.15, above the FactSet consensus of $1.09. Revenue rose 10.5% to $4.98 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $4.92 billion.

                                         were indicated down more than 2% in premarket trade Thursday, after the insurer reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations, as catastrophe losses increased, but revenue that beat forecasts as net written premiums rose to a record. Net income fell to $524 million, or $1.92 a share, from $595 million, or $2.11 a share, in the same period a year ago, as pre-tax catastrophe losses rose to $488 million from $403 million given an active tornado and hail season. Core earnings per share fell to $1.81 from $1.92, while the FactSet consensus was for a rise to $2.41. Total revenue increased 4% to $7.48 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $6.93 billion, as net written premiums grew 7% to $7.13 billion to beat expectations of $6.92 billion. The company said absent a severe hurricane season, it expects the second-quarter's catastrophe loss to be the highest quarterly loss of the year. The stock has shed 4.2% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF

The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control, which goes by the acronym BAFA, said it has attempted to hold talks with Tesla in recent months on the issue, but has failed to reach agreement. The subsidy is available for electric cars that cost no more than 60,000 euros, which is the list price for the basic Model S. But Tesla has been unable until now to deliver the basic model to its German clients, and more expensive trims do not qualify. About 800 customers are affected, according to a BAFA release. Customers who ordered a Model S after March 6 will receive the subsidy, after Telsa said it can deliver a basic version of the car.

","Stephen Bannon, former White House chief strategist and CEO of the Trump campaign, said he believed a trade war with China would result in victory for the U.S. ""Victory is if they give us access to their markets,"" he said at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference Wednesday in New York. The trade spat between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China has been characterized by actualized and threatened tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs would be positive for the U.S. economy and would bring manufacturing jobs back to the country, Bannon said. On the note of whether China could devalue its currency to fight the U.S. on the trade front, Bannon said it was an unlikely move due to the large amount of Chinese dollar-denominated foreign reserves.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.32 a share on sales of $3.5 billion in the quarter.

                                         had positive early results in a phase 3 clinical trial, the companies announced on Wednesday. The drug, tanezumab, met all three co-primary endpoints in the trial. Patients who received two doses of the drug had a statistically significant improvement in pain, physical function and their own assessment of their osteoarthritis, relative to patients on the placebo. Nearly 700 patients were enrolled in the trial, which was 16 weeks long, randomized and double-blind. Safety issues have been a longtime concern with the drug, but the companies said early data did not reveal any problems. More information about progressive osteoarthritis seen in patients is still needed, though, said EvercoreISI analyst Umer Raffat, and the companies in particular ""likely [need] longer follow up before being more definitive"" about tanezumab's safety. This class of drugs has previously worked almost too well for patients, such that their osteoarthritis has worsened, requiring joint replacements. Investors should watch for a 3,000 patient, 52-week trial, for which results are expected in 2019.

Speaking at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference, Greenberg , a prominent hedge-fund investor, said while Margate was bullish on the entire video-game sector, Take-Two possessed the best potential for a run-up. She has a price target of $176 on the stock, which represents upside of nearly 40% from its current price around $127. Shares of Take-Two turned positive after Greenberg's comments. She based her call on the view that Take-Two maintained industry-leading growth, a compelling valuation relative to its peers, and that it could be an attractive takeover target. More broadly, she cited ongoing the ongoing growth of video-game engagement, and the industry shift to recurring revenue streams. Take-Two shares were most recently up 0.3%, and has climbed 16% so far this year.

Gray said Wall Street investors should instead focus on the economy's strength. ""Waiting for an all-clear [on the trade issue] is a mistake,"" he said at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference. ""The biggest focus should be on the strength of the U.S. economy, which is stronger than most people realize."" He cited corporate profit growth and the labor market as support for his comments. ""There will be volatility, and there is risk"" from the trade issue, ""but in the fullness of time we're hopeful it will be resolved."" He added that ""things are fluid"" and that ""things can change"" in trade negotiations, but that it was in the interest of both the U.S. and its trading partners to avoid a full-on trade war. Against that backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                         shares surged more than 8% Wednesday, after the carrier reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and offered upbeat revenue guidance for the third quarter. The airline will host its earnings call at 10.30 a.m. Wednesday, so analysts provided just brief reactions to the numbers which were released after-hours on Tuesday, without raising ratings or price targets. Cowen said it had expected United to be the one airline that could report a positive earnings surprise, ""and indeed, they beat 2Q18 estimates and issued a 3Q18 forecast that will likely result in a positive stock price reaction and an improved earnings outlook,"" analysts led by Helane Becker wrote in a note. ""It appears as though capacity is growing toward the lower end of the range while unit revenue appears to exceed initial investor estimates."" Cowen rates the stock as market perform. At Stifel, analyst Joseph W. DeNardi said the numbers were ""really very nice and good."" DeNardi highlighted strong domestic PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, which rose 1.7% on a 7.4% increase in capacity, "", a strong result considering recent concerns over domestic pricing trends."" DeNardi rates the stock a buy. At Raymond James, analyst Savanthi Syth said investors are likely to react positively to the airline lowering the upper end of its 2018 capacity growth range for the second time, ""viewing it as a sign of capacity discipline."" Raymond James rates the stock as market perform. Shares have gained 16.2% in 2018, while the S&P 500 has gained 5.1%. ",2018-07-18T10:06:00-04:00,"

Speaking Wednesday morning at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York, he said the additional fiscal stimulus measures, coming after Trump's late-2017 corporate tax cuts, could boost gross domestic product to a range around 4%. He noted, however that GDP rate could lead to short-term revenue losses. On the note of trade, Kudlow said he wasn't a fan of blanket tariffs, reiterating his standard position on trade and tariffs. The Trump adviser said China should lower its tariff and non-tariff barriers and open up for business. However, he didn't believe President Xi Jinping of China wanted to make a deal, and with little progress in talks so far, Trump would keep on the pressure.

Marriott says the move would end the use of one billion plastic straws and a quarter billion plastic stirrers each year. The company is also removing plastic straws from its corporate headquarters. Earlier this year, Marriott began replacing the small plastic toiletry bottles at 450 select-service hotels with in-shower dispensers. They will be in more than 1,500 hotels in North America by the end of the year. The efforts are part of a plan to reduce landfill waste and responsibly source its top 10 products by 2025.

                                         shares surged 23% in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company said that one hemophilia patient in its phase 2/3 clinical trial had positive results, experiencing no bleeds on the high dose of Catalyst's therapy and only one bleed while on the lower dose. The patient has a historical annualized bleed rate of 26.7, the company said. The trial, testing the prophylactic marzeptacog alfa, or MarzAA,in patients with hemophilia A or B, has so far enrolled five of 12 total patients. Catalyst only released information about the one patient's results, and noted that two other subjects are in the first 50 days of dosing. Nevertheless, Catalyst Chief Executive Nassim Usman described the interim result as supporting ""our target of achieving significant reductions in annualized bleed rate,"" and announced plans to open more trial sites and increase enrollment this year. The phase 2 part of the study is expected to finish by the end of 2018, he added. Catalyst shares have dropped 56% over the last three months, compared with a 3.7% rise in the S&P 500

Net income rose to $2.27 billion, or $1.30 a share, from $1.59 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was $1.11. Total revenue increased to $10.61 billion from $9.50 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $10.05 billion, as better-than-expected institutional securities revenue helped offset wealth management and investment management revenue that came up shy of forecasts. Equity sales and trading revenue rose to $2.5 billion from $2.2 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $2.28 billion, while fixed income sales and trading revenue grew to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion to beat expectations of $1.33 billion.

","U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday eked out a victory in her battle to pass her Brexit plan through Parliament. The vote concerning an amendment to stay in the European Union's customs union was defeated by just six votes. This led to a new slew of criticism for May, who has been called too soft in her negotiations with Brussels and whose power in her administration has been questioned for months. Had May lost Tuesday's vote, it could have triggered a leadership crisis that could have resulted in a vote of confidence and fresh elections. Just last week, the government saw high profile resignations from chief Brexit negotiator David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, as well as two vice-chairs of the Conservative Party.

The trial, which is studying the therapy in patients with certain B-cell malignancies, intends to enroll about 80 participants total, according to Clinicaltrials.gov, and has an expected completion date of March 2019. The patient, who has a rare type of cancer called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, was administered two doses of the therapy, CLR 131, after which she showed the large reduction in tumor burden and complete resolution of four of five targeted tumor masses, the company said. Other symptoms that affected the patient's quality of life also improved, the treating physician, Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi, said. Importantly, the results of one patient may have no bearing on whether the trial is ultimately successful.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the so-called SALT tax law change, passed in late 2017 by Congressional Republicans, ""un-American."" He added: ""What you did was you divided the states, you penalized the Democratic states."" The suit seeks a court judgement that the tax policy is unconstitutional, and also asks for injunctive relief, Cuomo said. Among other precedents, it cites the 16th Amendment, which says the federal government's tax power can't be used to intrude on the sovereign authorities of the states to determine their own fiscal policies. Policymakers and advisors, in drafting the federal tax policy, spoke openly about their desire to punish states with majority Democratic bases, the suit notes. ",2018-07-17T10:34:00-04:00,"

Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $3.95 billion, or $1.45 per share, from $3.83 billion, or $1.40 per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $2.10, above the FactSet consensus of $2.07. Revenue rose to $20.83 billion from $18.84 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $20.39 billion. Pharmaceutical sales beat the consensus, with above-consensus sales for Simponi, Stelara, Prezisa/TMC, Concerta, Invega, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, and below-consensus sales of Remicade, Edurant and Xarelto. Sales of medical devices also came in above the consensus. Yet consumer sales came in below consensus, with oral care and women's health sales above consensus, while baby care, oral care, skin care and wound care sales were below consensus. Johnson & Johnson now expects 2018 sales of $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion, reflecting an increase in expected operational growth and offset by an estimated lower favorable impact of currency; the guidance is below the FactSet consensus of $81.4 billion.

","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said continued gradual interest-rate hikes was the ""best way forward"" for monetary policy. ""With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that - for now - the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,"" Powell said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. Powell said the unemployment rate is expected to fall further and the Fed's challenge will be to keep inflation close to 2%. Key unknowns are the outcome of the ongoing trade disputes and the impact of the Trump tax cuts and boost in federal spending, he said. ""Overall, we see the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening as roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than we currently anticipate,"" he said.

And it has a sourcing system to increase direct factory purchases, which can improve international sourcing. ""Additionally, with an average selling price of less than $15 and an average basket of approximately $65, the company believes that in some circumstances, price adjustments could be made without materially affecting its overall customer value proposition,"" At Home said.

He sees a number of reasons why Intel's stock is unlikely to outperform peers, including delays for the company's 10-nanometer transition and the recent resignation of Brian Krzanich, formerly Intel's CEO. ""Given these delays, the incoming CEO will need to address whether Intel intends to remain a technology leader and resolve some of the apparent execution issues, or be comfortable with generating substantial profits while holding back technology improvements until significant yields are achieved,"" Muse wrote. ""Given Intel's history, we find it hard to believe that it is willing to step back in such a manner - and the right CEO will find a way to push forward.""

Monday's slump for crude comes amid growing demand concerns. Indeed, International Monetary Fund data show a slowdown in global economic growth, which could drive down appetite for the commodity. Moreover, reports have suggested that President Donald Trump is considering a release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, though a draw down from the stockpile of crude is not imminent, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Crude-oil had enjoyed a renaissance of sorts on the back of successful efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and major producers of crude, to curb output. A series of supply disruptions also had contributed to what had mostly been an uptrend. In fact, WTI oil still maintains a 12% year-to-date gain, while Brent is up about 7.9% over the same period.

Harrigan is also concerned about competition from other streaming-video services, particularly overseas. ""India is especially intense - with entrants like market leader Hotstar priced at just $3 a month, including sports, as well as Amazon Prime,"" he wrote.

","Valeant Pharmaceutical International Inc. will start trading under a new name and ticker symbol on Monday as it switches to the name Bausch Health Cos. Inc. and ticker ""BCH."" The company has also launched a new corporate website at www.bauschhealth.com. Bausch stems from the company's well-known Bausch & Lomb eye products line. The name change comes after a rocky few years for the drug company, which was swept up in a drug pricing and accounting scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO.

Analyst Kevin Cassidy lifted his target to $21, which is 29% above Friday's closing price of $16.27, from $17, while reiterating his buy rating. ""The surprise upside may come from the company's Epyc server CPU gaining traction ahead of consensus expectations for 5% unit market share exiting 4Q18,"" Cassidy wrote in a note to clients. He added that he believes AMD can garner PC and server CPU market share from Intel throughout 2019, and deliver higher revenue growth than its larger rival.

However, the official announcement of his promotion had not been expected until later this year, the report said. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The bank's stock fell 0.4% to close at $226.41 on Friday and is down 11% for the year, underperforming the S&P 500

The contagious and often-deadly disease -- described as ""one of the world's most devastating diseases known to humanity"" by the World Health Organization -- has been considered eradicated since 1980 due to global immunization, but there have been fears that it could be used for bioterrorism, the FDA said. TPOXX was the first drug to receive a ""Material Threat Medical Countermeasure priority review voucher,"" which comes with various incentives for the drugmaker; the drug also received other special designations intended to encourage development of important drugs. To establish the product's safety, it was tested in 359 healthy humans who did not have smallpox, while the efficacy findings that the approval was based on were in animals. These types of approvals are allowed under the FDA's Animal Rule, used in cases when ""it is not feasible or ethical to conduct efficacy trials in humans,"" the FDA said.

The aerospace giant said the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that it is not entitled to recover certain costs associated with the sale of the facilities to Spirit Aerosystems. Boeing filed a suit against Spirit in 2014 seeking to enforce its right to indemnification and recover sums incurred to cover pension and retiree medical obligations. When it lost that case, it filed an appeal with the state's supreme court. The charge will not impact revenue or free cash flow.

These merchandise categories are key revenue drivers in the intermediate term. Cowen rates Amazon shares outperform. ""Prime which averaged ~60 million U.S. households in 2Q18 per our proprietary data will continue to be the core driver of US and international e-commerce growth over time, in our view,"" analysts led by John Blackledge wrote.

                                         announced Thursday afternoon that Chief Executive Wes Bush will step down at the end of this year and be replaced by Kathy Warden, the company's president and chief operating officer. Bush will remain chairman of the company through July 2019, the company said. ""I am delighted that Kathy will become our company's next CEO,"" Bush said in Thursday's announcement. ""She has demonstrated exceptional leadership in her roles leading the operations of our company, and she brings the vision and values to lead Northrop Grumman into the future."" The large defense contractor was embroiled in controversy last week, when ProPublica revealed that a Northrop Grumman employee who was part of a violent white-supremacist group had received a top U.S. security clearance. The employee lost his job a day after the report was published, and Bush sent an email to staff saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the report, according to ProPublica. When asked if the change was related to the controversy, a Northrop Grumman spokesman said ""the timing of Wes' retirement is the result of a very focused and disciplined succession planning process,"" noting that Warden was named president and COO a year ago in preparation.

In a separate announcement, Illinois public health officials said it had confirmed 90 cases of cyclosporiasis.

In one of the largest U.S. antitrust cases in decades, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled last month that the merger could go on despite the government's resistance. The feds did not seek a stay that would have prevented the merger from taking place, and AT&T and Time Warner closed the deal directly after Leon's ruling. AT&T stock fell 1.4% in late trading after closing with a 1.1% gain at $32.23, and has declined 17.1% this year as the S&P 500 index

In a release characterized as an ""opinion editorial"" from Dan McNamara, the leader of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, Intel said that it expects the deal to close in the third quarter. ""The addition of eASIC will help us meet customers' diverse needs of time-to-market, features, performance, cost, power and product life cycles,"" McNamara wrote. The move will expand Intel's move into FPGA chips, which was the main focus of its $16.7 billion acquisition in Altera Corp. in 2015. eASIC, founded in 1999, applied for an IPO in 2015, but eventually decided not to test the public markets.

The company said the Phase 3 study of its investigational drug ZX008 met its primary endpoint of reducing convulsive seizure frequency, as well as secondary endpoints. ""These impressive study results show the significant impact the addition of ZX008 made in reducing the burden of convulsive seizures for patients who are not adequately controlled using stiripentol, the standard of care for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in Europe,"" said Professor Rima Nabbout, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Pediatric Neurology, Reference Center for Rare Epilepsies, Necker Enfants Malades Hospital, and Principal Investigator of the trial, called Study 1504.

","Trade talks between the U.S. and China have recently halted after three rounds of negotiations amid mounting tensions between the two largest economies in the world, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing five people familiar with the situation. Officials from the U.S., led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have met with a Chinese team led by Vice Premier Liu He since May without any significant progress, the news agency said. For the moment, there are no plans to resume talks to break the impasse, setting the stage for a drawn out battle between the two economic giants. Stocks fell on Wednesday after the Trump administration announced plans to levy more tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products with the S&P 500

In July, four other analysts have raised their price targets on the stock. Of the 43 analysts who cover Salesforce, 38 have overweight or buy ratings and five have hold ratings, with an average target price of $150.69, according to FactSet.

Activision stock is up 1.6% to $77.41 and Disney stock is up 1.1% to $107.21 in early afternoon trading. The deal is another reminder of the rising popularity of pro videogame viewing, an industry that analysts expect to be worth hundreds of millions this year and billions in the future. The playoff games will begin Wednesday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on Disney XD, and ESPN3; the finals will air on ESPN later in July. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but ESPN said in a blog post that it was a multiyear contract and amounts to ""hundreds of hours of live and highlight programming"" across ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC and various streaming services. Overwatch League debuted in January with 12 teams representing cities such as Boston, New York Shanghai and Seoul, though the teams will all compete at an arena in Burbank, Calif. Disney stock is flat this year, as Activision has gained 22%.

The company then locks the account if the owner fails to validate it and change their password. Most of the activity will take place in the next few days and is likely to mean a change of four followers or fewer for most account holders. ""Follower counts are a visible feature, and we want everyone to have confidence that the numbers are meaningful and accurate,"" said Gadde.

As for Spotify, Kelley sees the company as well positioned to negotiate favorable terms with the labels due to its role in ""driving a music-industry recovery.""

The 12-month rate of wholesale inflation, meanwhile, climbed to 3.4% from 3.1%, marking the highest perch since the waning months of 2011. The core rate rose 0.3% in June.

                                         dropped 2.3% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the air carrier cut its second-quarter outlook for unit revenue growth, citing lower-than-anticipated domestic yields. The company now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase 1.0% to 3.0% from a year ago, compared with previous guidance of 1.5%-to-3.5% growth. The company also lowered its outlook for second-quarter capacity to 72.9 billion available seat miles from 73.1 billion, while increasing its estimate for the average per-gallon fuel price to $2.24 to $2.29 from $2.18 to $2.23. The company's outlook for cargo revenue rose to about $260 million from $250 million, and for other revenue to $695 million from $670 million. Separately, the company said it expects the IT issue that resulted in one of its regional carriers, PSA Airlines, to cancel about 3,000 flights in June to reduce pre-tax income by about $35 million.

","The head of Uber Technologies Inc.'s human resources department resigned Tuesday following allegations that she dismissed racial discrimination complaints at the company, Reuters reported. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi announced the resignation of Chief People Officer Liane Hornsey in an email seen by Reuters. Hornsey, who was one of Uber's leading voices on workplace diversity and discrimination, was reportedly under investigation for systematically dismissing internal racial-bias complaints. Uber has faced a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual and racial discrimination and harassment, including a female software engineer who sued in May. In March, Uber agreed to settle a class-action discrimination lawsuit by 420 female and minority employees for $10 million.

","Federal authorities will release hundreds of detained migrant families, who will be given ankle-bracelet tracking monitors, according to a New York Times report late Tuesday. That would effectively mean a return to the ""catch and release"" border policy that President Donald Trump had vowed to stop. The move comes after court rulings requiring children separated from their parents to be reunited, and preventing families from being held for more than 20 days. The Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy is still in effect, the Times said, and all adults found crossing the border illegally will be prosecuted, though not necessarily detained. An ICE official told the Times that migrant families would be given ankle bracelets ""and released into the community."" Earlier Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the government to reunite detained families quicker.

                                         had promised to roll back drug-price increases that he had targeted earlier this week, sending Pfizer stock down. ""Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients don't pay more,"" Trump said in a tweet that mentioned a meeting with Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. ""We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same."" Trump publicly railed against Pfizer and other drug manufacturers who were reportedly planning to increase costs on certain drugs on Monday. Pfizer confirmed the tweet in a statement later Tuesday, saying it would defer price increases that went into effect on July 1 ""to give the president an opportunity to work on his blueprint to strengthen the healthcare system and provide more access for patients."" Pfizer said it would hold off on increases until Trump's plan takes effect or the end of the year, whichever comes first. Pfizer stock fell about 0.9% in after-hours trading following Trump's tweet Tuesday, after posting daily gains in the regular sessions on Monday and Tuesday following the president's original tweets.

The Wall Street Journal reported about a half-hour before the close Tuesday that the European Commission expects to levy a large fine against Google for abusing Android's dominant position in smartphone operating systems to protect its mobile-advertising business. Based on multiple anonymous sources, the WSJ report said that the fine could surpass the $2.8 billion the commission charged Google for abusing its search dominance last year. The Financial Times previously reported that Google could face a fine of up to $11 billion in the investigation. Alphabet's class A shares declined to a slight loss on the day, after previously being up about 0.4%.

The company said it will keep operating its businesses as a ""debtor-in-possession"" under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Tintri said it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent with DataDirect Networks for the purchase of substantially all of its assets. Tintri has also arranged for financing, which is intended to bridge the company to the deal with DataDirect, under funds available under a debtor-in-possession credit facility with TriplePoint Capital LLC. Trintri's stock was up 9.1% to 20 cents in afternoon trade. The company went public on June 30, 2017 at an initial public offering price of $7. In March, the company announced that both its chief executive and chief financial officer were leaving the company.

","A glitch in the new tax law is hurting retailers and fast-food chains, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The goof prevents these firms from deducting their renovation costs immediately, rather than over many years.

Wieczynski said his upgrade might be a bit early, but said that World Cup is nearly over, and there hasn't been a huge correlation between VIP play at casinos over the long term and stock market turmoil. And the recent selloff in the stock suggests buyside expectations are now more realistic, and that the macro environment only has to remain ""somewhat status quo"" to produce upside. In addition, headline risk, which includes the fallout from allegations of sexual misconduct by Founder Steven Wynn, has been diminished. ",2018-07-10T09:05:00-04:00,"

Shares are down 0.9% in premarket trading. Hecht sees potential for Square due to a secular shift toward electronic, mobile, and contactless payments, but he is concerned about competitive pressures and credit exposure. ""Notwithstanding the opportunities, we believe that investors also need to balance this with considerations of risks - including competition and high growth targets in nascent business segments, which requires strong execution,"" he wrote. Hecht said that the Square Capital segment, which provides small-business loans, ""would experience pressure in a recession.""

Analyst Jack Micenko raised his rating to positive, after being at neutral for at least the past three years, and raised his stock price target to $36 from $34. Micenko said he sees a ""clear and visible path"" to further gross margin expansion and a re-acceleration in community count and order growth into 2019. He said he was eyeing an upgrade for several months, but waited to see the impact of the negative perception of rising interest rates. ""We believe there is not doubt that rising rates will ultimately pressure affordability broadly, but we think it will be at much higher levels--our work suggests 6% mortgage rates,"" Micenko wrote. During the July 5 week, 30-year fixed rate mortgages averaged 4.52%.

Analyst Youssef Squali cut his rating to hold, after being at buy since Jan. 12, and lowered his stock price target to $40 from $48. Squali said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month to reverse the 1992 precedent that states can require collection of sales tax without a physical presence increases the likelihood of a slowdown in gross merchandise value growth in 2019 and beyond. He said the new law reclassifies eBay as a ""broker,"" which would require all sales to be reported to the IRS. ""Logistically, we believe this is a daunting task for eBay as sellers would need to provide eBay with a social security or federal tax ID number, and report their profits to the IRS,"" Squali wrote in a note to clients.

Altaba would still hold about 1.36 billion shares in Yahoo Japan if they sell all the shares, though Japanese law requires that Softbank make an open tender that allows for any Yahoo Japan shareholder to sell shares to Softbank in the tender offer. Yahoo Japan, however, has launched a concurrent buyback offer that seeks more than 600 million shares. Altaba and Softbank also terminated their joint venture agreement that gave the two Yahoo Japan owners stated rights, though Altaba retained some rights regarding extraordinary transactions. Altaba has been looking for ways to cash in on some of the investments that remain in the Zombie Yahoo's coffers, mostly its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Barclays is maintaining a stock rating of overweight, but analysts voiced some concerns about Netflix's ""deluge of originals on the service,"" which they said could ""worsen user experience by making content discovery more difficult."" Analysts also noted Netflix's ability to raise debt at lower rates than its junk rating would suggest, writing that the turning of the credit cycle could be particularly disruptive if the company cannot turn cash flow positive in the next 2 to 3 years.

The Washington Post reported late Friday that Twitter had doubled its rate of account suspensions and kicked out 70 million accounts in May and June, a move that could endanger the user numbers that investors watch closely. On the social-network's service Monday, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal clarified that most of the accounts were not active in the previous thirty days, and thus would not be counted in Twitter's preferred ""monthly active user"" metric. ""If we removed 70M accounts from our reported metrics, you would hear directly from us,"" Segal said in a thread that was retweeted by Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Twitter stock was headed for its worst day since March on Monday, the first trading session since the report was released, but rebounded after Segal's tweets. Shares were still down more than 5% just before 2 p.m. Eastern time.

","Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Monday raised the S&P 500 earnings target for 2018 by 4% to $159, citing firmer oil prices and stronger economic growth. ""Higher oil prices are a benefit to S&P 500 EPS, where much of the index either produces commodities or supplies commodity producers,"" said Jill Carey Hall, an equity and quant strategist at BAML. The research team expects WTI/Brent to average $65 to $70 a barrel in 2018, roughly 25% higher than initially forecast earlier this year. ""Nearly 40% of the boost to our earnings forecasts both this year and next year comes from energy,"" said Hall. The U.S. economy is also expanding faster than expected with BAML economists projecting 2018 gross domestic product to rise 3%, 0.1 percentage point higher than the previous forecast. A one percentage point increase in GDP boosts EPS growth by around 3 percentage points, the strategists said. Second-quarter earnings season is scheduled to kick off later this week with big banks reporting. BAML strategists are projecting second-quarter S&P 500 earnings to rise more than 20% to $39.75.

The report, which was published Monday morning and titled ""Acadia Pharmaceuticals: This Is Not a Pharmaceuticals Company,"" found that the company used regulatory loopholes to get Nuplazid -- an anti-psychotic for Parkinson's disease -- approved, which allegedly masked issues with how safe the drug is and how well it works. The drug has been heavily marketed for use in patients with dementia in long-term care facilities. Though there is a warning on the drug about safety issues with that population, the most safety issues, or adverse events, with the drug nevertheless occurred within that group, according to the report. The report also questions the company's sales tactics, describing them as: ""In a word, Acadia didn't just open up its corporate wallet for doctors: It pointed a hose and sprayed cash at them.""

On Friday, the U.S. imposed levies on $34 billion of China's exports. In response, China's State Council said it applied tariffs on 545 U.S. items ranging from agricultural products to vehicles. But a stronger-than-expected labor-market report, showing that 213,000 jobs were created in June, overshadowed those persistent worries over tariffs and the potential knock-on effects from such clashes.

""By reducing dependence on software and instead managing the model to existing advantages in hardware & peripherals, content & community...and opportunity areas [in] digital, tech, & collectibles, we see GameStop evolving from a purveyor of packaged media toward a hub for gamer connections, platform & accessory purchases, and fan culture products,"" she wrote. Wissink said that GameStop's ""rearchitecting"" could take more than three years, but she argued that its current valuation doesn't reflect the possibility that the company can transform its business model. She has a $18 price target on the stock, which is down 28% over the past 12 months, compared with a 14% rise for the S&P 500

The VIX--another name for the fear index, referring to its ticker symbol--tends to climb as stocks fall. A weekly decline exceeding around 14.5% would represent its steepest fall since the week ended April 13, when it declined by nearly 19%, according to FactSet data. A weekly slump for the VIX would also represent its first such slide after to straight weeks of gains of at least 14%. On Friday, the Trump administration officially imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports at midnight Eastern Time, and Beijing implemented tariffs on the same value in U.S. goods, as promised, underscoring mounting tensions on global trade. However, investors have appeared to focus on upbeat data, with Friday's jobs report showing that 213,000 jobs were created in June, better than estimates. Although the unemployment rate increased to 4% from 3.8%, an 18-year low, more job applicants entered the workforce, Labor Department data indicated. On Friday midday, the S&P 500 was trading 0.8% higher at 2,758, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The announcement comes after The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week, citing people familiar with the situation, that the company agreed to sell half of HBC Europe's operating company to Austria-based Signa Holding GMBH in a deal that would bring in more than $1 billion in cash. On Friday, Hudson's Bay said in a statement: ""While HBC does not generally comment publicly on market speculation or rumors, in light of recent media reports, HBC believes it is prudent to advise stakeholders that it is in discussions with SIGNA Holding GmbH and has signed a non-binding letter of intent with respect to the exploration of a potential joint venture."" The company said any potential transaction is subject to further review, and there can be no assurance that any discussions will lead to a deal.

Susquehanna Financial's Shyam Patil kept his rating at positive and his stock price target at $305, which is 63% above Thursday's closing price of $186.88, and the highest target among the 47 analysts surveyed by FactSet. The stock edged up 0.1% in premarket trade Friday. Patil now expects fiscal first-quarter revenue to rise 61.5%, down from previous estimate to 63.0% growth, because the consolidation of the Ele.me food-delivery platform ""occurred mid-quarter vs. previous expectations for a full quarter on the books."" Meanwhile, Patil raised his digital media revenue estimate, citing Youku's World Cup streaming rights, which ""should be a tailwind for new subscriber additions"" for the next several quarters.

                                         finished up about 1.1% at 7,586. An account of the June meeting from the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's two-day convention ended June 13 pointed to unease over trade clashes that could hold back economic growth but not sufficiently to prevent the Fed from hiking benchmark interest rates. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last month to a range between 1.75% and 2% and indicated that a further two rate increases were in the cards for 2018. Meanwhile, the U.S. is scheduled to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports Friday, and China is expected to counter with corresponding tariffs on U.S. imports in less than 24 hours, marking a mounting tit-for-tat conflict between the world's largest economies that has threatened to rattle global markets. Equity and commodity exchanges in the U.S. were closed in observance of Independence Day on Wednesday. Looking ahead, investors will await a key report on jobs on Friday that could influence investor sentiment. The day's action began on a high note on reports that suggested the U.S. was softening its stance against the European Union, with an offer of a ""zero solution"" to car tariffs.

Many of the central bank's business contacts had expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other trade restrictions on future investment activity both in the U.S. and abroad, according to the minutes. Some contacts said they were postponing or scaling backing plans for capital spending. Contacts in the aluminum and steel industries expected higher prices from tariffs already in place, but said they had no plans for new investment to increase capacity. Despite this concern, there was broad support among policy makers of continued ""gradual"" rate hikes. Officials noted that the benchmark federal funds rate could be at or above its ""neutral"" level ""sometime next year."" That is the level that neither boosts or dampens activity.

They rose by 1.2 million barrels, the EIA said. The data were released a day later than usual because of Wednesday's Independence Day holiday. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts had forecast a fall of 4.5 million barrels, and the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a drop that matched that forecast, according to sources. Gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.5 million barrels for the week, but distillate stockpiles were up by 100,000 barrels for the week, according to the EIA.

Such a deal would see the U.S. stop its threats to impose such duties in exchange for the European Union eliminating its levies, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday said Germany was willing to cut import tariffs on cars as a way to end the Europe-U.S. trade standoff. However, The U.S. is scheduled to impose tariffs of 25% on $34 billion of Chinese imports Friday and China is expected to counter that move, as the world's two largest economies face off.

","Claude Lanzmann, the French film-maker and journalist who is best known for the more than 9-hour holocaust documentary ""Shoah,"" has died aged 92, French newspaper Le Monde reported Thursday. The news was confirmed by his family, although no cause of death was offered. Lanzmann spent 11 years making ""Shoah,"" which has a running time of 560 minutes. The son of Russian Jewish immigrants to France won many awards for the documentary, which was released in 1985, including the New York Times Critics Circle award for best non-fiction film, the BAFTA award for best documentary, the Berlin International Film Festival Caligari film award, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association special award. The director's final film, Napalm, was shown at Cannes in 2017 and centered around visits made to North Korea as a young journalist. ",2018-07-05T09:38:00-04:00,"

Volume topped 2.2 million shares ahead of the open. The company said it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., in which Mercuria intends to provide a $1 billion trade financial facility to support Aegean's revolving credit facilities. Once the facility is closed, Aegean will issue new shares equal to 30% of its common stock to Mercuria and invite a Mercuria representative to its board of directors. The agreement may also lead to a strategic partnership, including operational services, trading and hedging arrangements. On Tuesday, the stock had closed at a record low of 63 cents, about a month after the company said it would have to write off about $200 million worth of accounts receivables owed to the company because an accounting review found that the receivables may have been ""without economic substance and improperly accounted for.""

Xplore shares are halted until 8:30 a.m. ET, while Zebra shares were still inactive in the premarket. Under terms of the deal, Zebra will pay $6 in cash for each Xplore share outstanding, which represents a 48% premium to Tuesday closing price of $4.05. Zebra expects to fund the deal, which it expects will close in the third quarter, with cash on hand and financing under its credit facility. Separately, Xplore reported a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss that widened to $638,000, or 5 cents a share, from $488,000, or 4 cents a share, and revenue that rose 20% to $20.3 million.

                                         said Thursday it will recommend that shareholders vote in favor of a $437 million deal to be taken private by its founder and former executive chairman George Feldenkreis. The committee, which is made up of independent directors, said the deal is ""substantially"" similar to an unsolicited bid made earlier this week by men's accessories company Randa Accessories. Randa is offering $28 a share for Perry Ellis, or 50 cents more than the $27.50 offer made by Feldenkreis. ""The Special Committee unanimously determined, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the Randa proposal does not satisfy the requirements in the Feldenkreis merger agreement for granting due diligence access or commencing negotiations with respect to a competing takeover proposal,"" it said in a statement. The Randa proposal is highly conditional, non-binding and insufficient in terms of value and certainty of the debt financing commitments and a lack of evidence of sufficient cash equity on hand, said the statement. The Feldenkreis deal is expected to close in the second half, subject to approvals by shareholders and regulators. Perry Ellis shares were not yet active premarket, but have gained 16.9% in 2018, while the S&P 500

The company, which is developing cannabis-based therapies for rare neruospsychiatric disorders, said the trial of ZYN001, a patent-protected, pro-drug of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) delivered via a transdermal patch, in healthy volunteers, did not achieve its goal of target blood levels of 5 to 14 ng/ml THC. ""This Phase 1 study was a single and multiple dose, placebo-controlled first-in-man study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of ZYN001 administered as a transdermal patch to healthy adult subjects,"" Zynerba said in a statement. ""Several formulations and patch wear times ranging from 24 hours to 14 days were assessed in in 60 healthy subjects who were randomized to ZYN001 or placebo."" The company will now focus its efforts on its ZYN002 Fragile X syndrome, a treatment for epilepsy.

It was unclear exactly when Pruitt floated his plan, but Trump has publicly complained about Sessions for months, and as recently as April suggested replacing him with Pruitt. Late Tuesday, Priutt denied the report, saying it was ""simply false"" and that ""I want nothing more than to see [Sessions] succeed in his role.""

""We see continued pressure on gross margins, which we expect to decline 250 basis points to 41.0% in FY 18,"" analyst Elizabeth Vermillion wrote in a note. ""We anticipate 1.0% to 1.5% revenue growth in FY 18."" The lighting company closed the regular session up 12.8%, after earnings blew past estimates. The company said it had net income of $73.0 million, or $1.80 a share, in the quarter to May 31, down from income of $82.2 million, or $1.90 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $2.37, well ahead of the FactSet consensus of $2.17. Sales rose to $944.0 million from $891.6 million, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $899 million. Sales were driven by shipments of the company's Atrius-based luminaires, as well as higher shipments of products for infrastructure and utility projects. Those items were partially offset by lower net sales for larger commercial projects, Chief Executive Vernon Nagel said in a statement.

Tesla said its additional production line, which was built in a tent, produces the same quality as its regular line. ""However, we question whether Tesla can really evaluate customer satisfaction yet, when 11,166 Model 3s (likely including a majority of those manufactured on GA4) still remain undelivered in transit,"" said the note. Sacconaghi questioned whether the tent will be maintained indefinitely and whether the mostly manual work being performed on it can be automated and at what cost. If Tesla did not have room in its Fremont plan to build capacity for 5,000 cars a week, how will it manage 10,000, the analyst asked. Tesla shares were trading down 5% Tuesday, and are now up just 2% in 2018, matching the S&P 500's

Analysts said the the strong selloff in the stock and other lithium stocks in the last few quarters were driven by ""a jarring sentiment shift from optimistic enthusiasm for the potential of lithium to fuel the electric vehicle (EV) revolution to growing concerns about aggressive lithium supply expansions that threaten to expose lithium as just another commodity metal."" Their analysis suggests that the lithium market will remain attractive and offer strong returns to leaders in the sector. They see upside potential of 34% for Albemarle, and 30% for rival FMC corp.

                                         rose 0.5% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the automaker reported a June sales rise, as growth in truck and SUV sales offset a big drop in car sales. Total U.S. sales rose 1.2% from a year ago to 230,635 vehicles, with truck sales rising 3.2% to 100,683 vehicles and SUV sales climbing 8.9% to 84,617 vehicles, while car sales tumbled 14.0% to 45,335 vehicles. Among trucks, F-Series sales rose 1.7% to 79,204 vehicles and Transit sales grew 25% to 13,533 vehicles, while E-Series sales fell 25% to 3,724 vehicles. Among the highest-selling Ford-brand cars, Fusion sales fell 14% to 15,678 vehicles and Focus sales dropped 30% to 10,910 vehicles.

                                         surged more than 14% in premarket trade Tuesday, after he lighting company blew past estimates for its fiscal third quarter. The company said it had net income of $73.0 million, or $1.80 a share, in the quarter to May 31, down from income of $82.2 million, or $1.90 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $2.37, well ahead of the FactSet consensus of $2.17. Sales rose to $944.0 million from $891.6 million, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $899 million. Sales were driven by shipments of the company's Atrius-based luminaires, as well as higher shipments of products for infrastructure and utility projects. Those items were partially offset by lower net sales for larger commercial projects, Chief Executive Vernon Nagel said in a statement. The company is expecting demand in the North American lighting market to improve in the second half, although pricing is expected to remain challenging in some parts of the market.

","People's Bank of China officials offered informal intervention on behalf of the flagging yuan in separate comments Tuesday. The two officials commented as the yuan traded at its lowest levels in 11 months amid China-U.S. trade friction. PBoC Governor Yi Gang said on the central bank's site that China will ""keep the yuan exchange rate basically stable at [a] reasonable and balanced level."" That statement, and comments by another central bank official earlier on Tuesday, are the first clear remarks on the currency from authorities since the yuan started weakening in mid-June. The yuan has retreated some 3.7% against the U.S. dollar over the past three weeks. ""Recently the foreign exchange market has shown some volatility and we're paying close attention to that,"" Yi said.

The state-owned telecommunications company applied for a license through the Federal Communications Commission to offer its services from within the U.S. back in 2011. The agency then went back to the Trump administration to get its opinion on that request, a response that came in a statement on Monday. ""After significant engagement with China Mobile, concerns about increased risks to U.S. law enforcement and national security interests were unable to be resolved,"" said David J.

","Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel reached an agreement on immigration late Monday with the Christian Social Union, led by interior minister Horst Seehofer, which could help keep intact a fragile coalition. Seehofer had been critical of the chancellor's approach to immigration and offered his resignation over the weekend. That could have led Germany down the path of fresh elections, which would have brought more uncertainty, political and otherwise. But under the compromise reached on Monday, Seehofer will remain interior minister. As part of the deal, the German-Austrian border will be strengthened and detention centers will be established, according to a Dorothee Baer, minister of state, who tweeted out the agreement. Monday's talks had been closely watched by investors, and weighed on European assets.

Tesla confirmed the move in a statement to WSJ, saying ""After almost five years at Tesla, Doug Field is moving on. We'd like to thank Doug for his hard work over the years and for everything he has done for Tesla."" Field, the senior vice president for engineering, had taken a leave of absence in early May.

""It's not that complicated: Simplified SOTP suggests Remainco GE [is] significantly overvalued,"" Tusa wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underweight rating and $11 stock price target. ""2019 is promising to be another 'transition year,' with heavy restructuring and little relief at Power, on which implied multiples show significant disconnect vs. peers, particularly on cash metrics,"" Tusa wrote.

KBR agreed to pay a $2.5 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. The backlog metric represented the amount of revenue that KBR expected to receive in the future from firm orders under awarded contracts. The SEC allegedly found KBR included $459 million in its publicly disclosed backlog in the second quarter of 2012 for one of seven contracts it entered into to complete pipe fabrication and modular assembly contracts in Canada, even though KBR had not received -- and the counterparty was not obligated to provide -- any orders under the contract. KBR violated its internal reporting policies and misled investors by overstating its work in backlog for almost two years. KBR was forced to restate its financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2013 for a total negative impact of $156 million.",2018-07-02T14:59:00-04:00,"

Colonial was one of the twenty-five largest banks in the United States when it went bankrupt in 2009 with over $26 billion in assets. In a fraud that began in 2002 and was exposed by regulators in 2009, Colonial Bank employees conspired with Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corporation executives. The judge had previously ruled after a bench trial that PwC violated its professional duties to Colonial by negligently performing its 2003-2005 and 2008 audits. The judge said PwC did not design its audits so as to enable it to detect fraud and PwC did not obtain sufficient competent evidence to support any of those opinions.",2018-07-02T14:40:00-04:00,"

A Financial Times report on Sunday headlined simmering worries about clashes between the U.S. and trade partners in the European Union, China and North America. The FT report indicates that the EU has threatened $300 billion in fresh tariffs on U.S. products if President Donald Trump follows through on a threat of 20% levies targeting the trade bloc's auto makers. Canadian retaliatory tariffs took effect Sunday, with those measures serving as a response to U.S. metals tariffs. Separately, Axios reported that the Trump administration had crafted a draft bill that would declare America's abandonment of World Trade Organization rules, which could offer Washington more latitude to enact more severe trade tariffs against its global partners. Meanwhile, markets also were focusing on political uncertainties in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel and her interior minister were set to meet later Monday in a last attempt to resolve a spat in immigration in the country that could result in heightened instability in politics in Germany, the largest economy in the EU. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday in observance of Independence Day. ",2018-07-02T09:39:00-04:00,"

""For the first time, ARISTADA INITIO, in combination with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, provides physicians with an alternative regimen to initiate patients onto any dose of ARISTADA on day one,"" the company said in a statement. The treatment is expected to support schizophrenia patients who have difficulties with medication complicance and continuity of care, notably for those moving from inpatient to outpatient care. ""The approval of ARISTADA INITIO makes ARISTADA the first and only long-acting atypical antipsychotic that can be initiated on day one, representing an important addition to the treatment paradigm for the complex illness of schizophrenia,"" said David Walling, Ph.D., chief executive and principal investigator of the Collaborative Neuroscience Network. ""For physicians and caregivers alike, the ARISTADA INITIO regimen provides a level of confidence that patients can walk out the door with up to two months of coverage with a proven medication in their system.""

Dell issued Class V shares after the EMC merger closed, which those shares having a 1-to-1 relationship with about 61% of VMware common stock owned by Dell. Under terms of the deal, the Class V shares will be converted into rights to receive 1.3665 Class C common stock, representing a total consideration to Class V shareholders of $21.7 billion.

The dividend Dell receives from VMware will be used to fund the deal, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In 2014, the FTC alleged AbbVie and its partner Besins Healthcare Inc. blocked consumer access to lower cost versions of the testosterone replacement drug Androgel. The FTC accused AbbVie of using ""sham litigation"" to maintain its monopoly. AbbVie has previously denied the allegations and the breakdown of relief between AbbVie and Besins was not immediately clear. ""This decision is a double victory, both for patients who rely on Androgel and for competition more broadly,"" said FTC chairman Joe Simons. ""It sends a clear signal that pharmaceutical companies can't use baseless litigation to forestall competition from low-cost generics."" The decision handed down in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania is the largest monetary award in a litigated FTC antitrust case, the agency said. AbbVie stock was flat in after hours trading, and closed up 0.2% to $92.65 during the regular session.

Netflix countersued, alleging Fox was ""facilitating and enforcing a system that restrains employee mobility, depresses compensation levels, and creates unlawful barriers to entry for Netflix and others competing in the film and television production business..."" Fox came back with an anti-SLAPP motion, but a trial judge ruled that Netflix's cross-complaint should move forward, with which an appeals court on Friday agreed. California associate justice Lamar Baker wrote: ""In our independent judgment, Netflix's cross-claims do not arise from Fox's prelitigation communications or litigation activity. Rather, Netflix's claims are predicated on Fox's business practices related to the fixed-term agreements.""

","Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. highly-anticipated business update fell flat for many analysts because it lacked details, but SunTrust Robinson Humphrey thinks what was presented will give the second half of 2018 a bump. Things like the addition of pickup shelves, menu innovation and a new marketing campaign ""will be the beginning of ""a multi-year same-store sales recovery,"" wrote analysts led by Jake Bartlett. On the call, Chipotle's Chief Executive Brian Niccol said the addition of a window with a sign designating it for digital order pickups in Denver ""caused a double-digit increase in our digital sales within the first few weeks, and it sustained."" While adding windows to all restaurants would take too long, Niccol said self-serve shelves would do the trick and be more cost-effective. ""We expect the addition of pickup shelves and delivery ordering capabilities on the app, as well as related marketing to boost digital sales from 8.8% in 1Q18 to double digits by 4Q18,"" wrote SunTrust.

The trial met its primary endpoint of red blood cell transfusion independence of at least eight straight weeks during the first 24 weeks, as compared with the placebo, a ""highly"" statistically significant improvement; the key secondary endpoint was also met. Myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by abnormal cells in the bone marrow, and are considered a type of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. The companies will now prepare for global regulatory submissions for the drug, luspatercept, including a plan to file for approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2019. Should the drug -- which isn't currently approved for any diseases -- get approved, it could ""start to be impactful to 2020 and beyond,"" said Raymond James analyst Laura Chico, describing the development as ""a welcomed data point for CELG,"" which should lose patent protection on key drugs in upcoming years, and has struggled to get other important products approved.

The move is expected to generate annualized cost savings of about $10 million and to be mostly complete by December. The lab develops pain management active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs. ""In recent years the regulatory and competitive landscape for pain management APIs has changed, extending Cody's timeline to profitability and causing us to revise our plan for this business,"" Lannett Chief Executive Tim Crew said in a statement.

The deal, which The Wall Street Journal reported was in the works just before markets closed Thursday, is expected to close by the end of the year and combine Convergys with Synnex's own call-center division, called Concentrix. Convergys shares jumped after the report of the acquisition, closing with a 4.8% gain at $25.37. Synnex shares fell, though that was likely more the result of the company's earnings report, delivered earlier in after-hours time, and a weaker than expected profit forecast. Synnex reported net income of $93.7 million, or $2.34 a share, on revenue of $4.97 billion, up from $3.93 billion a year ago. After adjustments for amortization and other effects, Synnex claimed profit of $2.38 a share. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of $2.30 a share on sales of $4.67 billion, according to FactSet. While Synnex beat those expectations, it predicted adjusted earnings for the current quarter of $2.42 to $2.52 a share, and analysts on average were expecting $2.56 a share, according to FactSet. Synnex shares fell 4.2% in late trading, after closing with a 0.8% decline.

The index was up as much as 0.9% earlier in the session, which set it up for the longest win streak (11 sessions) since July 1992, but some late-day weakness turned the index lower. The utilities sector tends to outperform the broader market in the late stages of a business cycle and in a recession, given the defensive nature of the sector, and because falling Treasury yields tend to make the relatively high dividend yields of utilities stocks more attractive.

                                         sales outlook is at risk thanks to the ouster of the German team from World Cup competition, wrote Wedbush analysts led by Christopher Svezia. Germany is the athletic company's top sponsored team, the country is the company's top market, and the World Cup is a major sales driver. In the second half of 2014 when Germany won, incremental jersey sales rose 10%. The early elimination could have a low-single-digit impact on Western European sales mostly in the third quarter, analysts say, after ""softer growth"" in the second quarter. ""The best case for the region's sales going forward would now be for Spain to advance toward the final or win the World Cup,"" Wedbush wrote. Analysts rate Adidas' shares neutral with a target price of €180. Adidas also announced a potential data breach in the U.S. on Thursday. Shares are down 2.7% in Thursday trading, but have rallied 10% for the year to date.

                                         will likely release its second-quarter delivery numbers by Tuesday, July 3, Baird analysts said Thursday, and they are buyers into the release. Baird rates Tesla stock outperform and has designated it a fresh pick, meaning it deems the stock a high-conviction investment based on fundamental or quantitative factors until a specified expiration date. ""The primary focus will likely be on exit rate Model 3 production, and we believe shares could trade higher if the company approaches its targets,"" analysts led by Ben Kallo wrote in a note. ""Additionally, we believe investors will look for total Model 3s produced in June (if the company releases June data) in an effort to gauge steady-state production rates."" Baird is expecting deliveries of about 25,000 vehicles with more in the channel, although the focus will be more on production than delivery. The FactSet consensus is for 28,000 Model 3 deliveries, out of 51,000 vehicles in total. ""Consensus estimates for Q2 deliveries may be too high, particularly given our belief there could be a larger-than-normal delta between production and deliveries due to the ramp during the quarter,"" said Kallo. ""That said, Elon Musk's recent email could indicate the company is tracking ahead of consensus expectations.""

Cowen & Co. analyst Karl Ackerman wrote Thursday that the combined company will be a ""formidable powerhouse in networking,"" as the acquisition will give Marvell more exposure to the data-center business and to generally higher-end products. He said it would ""facilitate share gains for those data center customers needing a second source for switching silicon to Broadcom Inc.

","Shares of Arsanis Inc., a clinical-stage biotech, slid 73% in premarket trade Thursday, after the company said it is discontinuing a Phase 2 trial of a treatment for pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients after determining that it was unlikely to meet its main goals. The trial sought to evaluate ASN100 in reducing S. aureus pneumonia compared to placebo. ""We are disappointed that this clinical study was futile despite the survival benefit of ASN100 as compared to placebo observed in preclinical models of pneumonia, however Arsanis remains confident in the potential of monoclonal antibodies to prevent and treat serious infections, while also reducing the threat of antibiotic resistance,"" said René Russo, chief executive of Arsanis.

While the index has twice topped this level on an intraday basis in the past couple of weeks, settling at its current level would represent its highest close since April 11. The Volatility Index has risen of late, tracking a general decline in the equity market that has been largely fueled by uncertainty over trade policy. The VIX is up 33.6% thus far this week, compared with the 1.9% decline of the S&P 500. The Cboe index has jumped about 40% over the past month, a move that has brought its year-to-date climb to about 67%. Despite those gains, it remains below its long-term average, which is between 19 and 20.

That's the second insider-trading case on the Equifax breach the SEC has brought. According to the complaint, Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14%, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, the SEC said. He was terminated by Equifax in March after not cooperating with the company's internal investigation.",2018-06-28T10:16:00-04:00,"

The company has launched a external search for a new CFO. Maw had joined Starbucks in 2011 as global controller, and was promoted to CFO in February 2014. Just prior to the CFO announcement, the stock was up less than 0.1% in premarket trade. Earlier this month, executive chairman Howard Schultz said he was stepping down.

                                         deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack may also be weighing on Rite Aid shares. The company reported late Wednesday net income for the quarter to June 2 of $214.4 million, or 20 cents a share, after a loss of $75.3 million, or 7 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was 1 cent, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $5.39 billion from $5.44 billion, just above the FactSet consensus of $5.33 billion. Retail pharmacy same-store sales fell 0.7%, as front-end sales declined 1.8% and pharmacy sales slipped 0.1%. The pharmacy sales decline includes a 1.33 percentage points negative impact from new generic introductions. For fiscal 2019, revenue is expected to be $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion, which doesn't include the impact of the impending acquisition of Albertons. J.P. Morgan reiterated its neutral rating on Rite Aid, saying the shares aren't trading on fundamentals given the pending Albertsons deal.

The company said the trial of Taltz met its primary and secondary endpoints, showing a statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of the disease at 16 weeks, compared with placebo. ""These positive results, in combination with previous results from the Phase 3 COAST-V study, provide further support for Taltz as a potential treatment option for patients with AS, including those who have had an inadequate response to treatment with TNF inhibitors, a difficult-to-treat population,"" said Dr. Lotus Mallbris, vice president, Immunology Development, at Eli Lilly. The company is planning to submit data from the trial at scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals later this year and expects to submit is for U.S. regulatory approval later this year.

                                         shares dropped in after-hours trading Wednesday after the restaurant chain's top executives detailed restructuring plans that include closing dozens of locations. New Chief Executive Brian Niccol and other executives held a conference call Thursday afternoon to discuss changes under the new management team, which included plans to add delivery options to the chain's mobile app and areas specifically for picking up food at stores. Shares turned lower after Chief Financial Officer John Hartung detailed the costs of restructuring and revealed that Chipotle plans to close 55 to 65 stores. ""In aggregate, we expect these costs to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million,"" Hartung said, with $50 million to $60 million recorded in the second quarter and most of the rest in the second half of 2018. Hartung said about half of the closures will happen in the next 30 days, while those closures that involve more complicated lease buyouts will stretch longer. Hartung stressed that Chipotle was not updating nor reaffirming its financial guidance, but outlining non-recurring charges.

","St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Wednesday that the Fed's benchmark interest rate could already be at a neutral level and the central bank may go ""too far"" if it stays on its path of further rate hikes. ""A misinterpretation of where we are is a distinct possibility,"" Bullard said, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. ""That's why I'm trying to push against faster rate hikes,"" he said. Earlier this month, the Fed lifted the benchmark rate to a range between 1.75% and 2% and penciled in two more rate hikes this year. Bullard, who has been arguing for going slow on rates all year, said he thinks the neutral rate might be 2%. The majority of Fed officials think the neutral rate is closer to 3%.

                                         rose 0.7% in afternoon trade toward a 10th-straight gain, which would match the longest win streak in nearly 12 years. Because utilities tend to have high dividend yields and are also less volatile than growth stocks, the sector often acts as a proxy for the bond market. As interest rates rise, and bond prices fall, investors often shed utilities because the incentive to accept higher equity risk for higher yields is diminished; when interest rates fall, utilities tend to rally as investors look for higher yields. The Dow utilities current win streak comes, however, after the Federal Reserve raised its fed funds target rate to 1.75% to 2.00% on June 13, the second rate hike this year, and signaled that there could be two more hikes later this year. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has declined 15.1 basis points since June 13 to 2.826%. Around the 10-day win streak ending Oct. 23, 2006, the fed funds rate had already peaked and the Fed said the housing market was a ""significant drag"" on economic activity.

The department's antitrust division filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to block the acquisition, but also filed a proposed settlement it said would resolve the competitive harm alleged in its lawsuit.

Oil shares have climbed as crude oil has enjoyed a boost after the Trump administration said it would sanction countries that don't cut their imports of Iranian oil to zero.

He wrote that while there is ""significant uncertainty"" about how the company's various efforts will play out, the stock's valuation seems to reflect those already. ""We retain some of our longer term concerns around the sector and stock, but believe that over the next 12 months, the path of least resistance for AT&T's stock is to trade higher,"" Flannery wrote. He will be watching for the company's ability to reduce leverage and realize synergies from its Time Warner deal.

""The moderated expectations help assuage the risk of not beating by enough, adding further upside potential to reported numbers,"" Henderson wrote.

The A- rating is four notches above speculative grade, or junk, territory.

""The CreditWatch placement reflects our belief that near-term cost increases due to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU, combined with other significant headwinds, could cause margin deterioration and increase business risks over the next several years,"" S&P said in a statement.

The news on Beijing's investment in U.S. tech assets comes amid elevated tensions between China and the U.S., which have helped to rattle equity benchmarks across the globe. Earlier in the week, reports indicated that Trump wanted to curb investments by China in U.S. technology corporations, which heightened concerns that a full-scale trade war between the two largest economies, which could spill over into global economies, was nearing. However, the recent White House statement suggests that the President rejects more-aggressive restrictions on Chinese investments. ",2018-06-27T08:17:00-04:00,"

                                         plunged 77% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the biotech said a trial of a treatment for the serious disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failed to meet its main goals. The Phase 2 clinical trial, called PhaseOut DMD, sought to evaluate the company's utrophin modulator, ezutromid, in 40 patients with DMD, but failed to meet its primary endpoint after 48 weeks. ""These data come as a great disappointment to us and to all those living with DMD,"" said Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer of Summit. ""While we believe utrophin modulation could still have a place in the treatment of DMD, it is clear that ezutromid is not providing a benefit for patients. We therefore feel that our resources are better focused on the development of our promising pipeline of new mechanism antibiotics."" Utrophin is a protein naturally produced by the human body when muscle first forms or when it's repairing. As muscle matures, it is replaced by dystrophin, but for DMD patients, dystrophin does not function properly. The company will stop development of ezutromid and take cost-cutting measures.

                                         fell 1.1% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the branded consumer foods company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, while sales matched forecasts. Net income for the quarter to May 27 fell to $354.4 million, or 59 cents a share, from $408.9 million, or 69 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 79 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 71 cents. Sales increased 2.2% to $3.89 billion, as better-than-expected convenience store and foodservice sales offset a miss in North America retail sales, its largest sales segment. For fiscal 2019, organic net sales are expected to be flat to up 1%, or up 9% to 10% if the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition is included. The FactSet consensus $17.28 billion implies 9.8% revenue growth.

The trial, called LEADERSHIP 301, ""was a robust and well-conducted trial, and we believe the results are definitive."" The company said the results support halting all further development, but it plans to review its pipeline and provide further guidance later this year. The trial involved 433 participants who received Aquinox's once-daily, oral rosiptor, or AQX-1125, or placebo. It failed to achieve a statistically significant reduction in mean change from Baseline at Week 12 in maximum daily bladder pain score inthe female patients, which was its primary endpoint.

","Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House and once seen as a possible successor to Nancy Pelosi as minority leader, suffered a stunning primary loss to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old community activist running on a progressive agenda, was outspent by an 18-1 margin and ran on a platform of Medicare for all and reining in Wall Street. Crowley, 56, was first elected to Congress in 1999 and was a mainstay of the Democratic establishment, while Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by MoveOn.org and the Democratic Socialists of America. The result may be the biggest primary upset since Virginia Republican Rep. Eric Cantor lost in 2014. New York's 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, is heavily Democratic, and Ocasio-Cortez becomes the heavy favorite to win the general election in November.

The recent losses have come despite the Federal Reserve last week saying that all the banks it had examined in a ""stress test"" met the regulatory minimums for capital.

While banks typically outperform in periods of rising interest rates, bond yields have stalled after a rise earlier this year. ",2018-06-26T16:56:00-04:00,"

""Major producers are taking a more anticipatory approach to DRAM [dynamic random-access memory] bit supply - averting the downside case that we laid out when launching Micron"" with a sell rating in April, Arcuri wrote. ""While we maintain fairly draconian views on NAND pricing and 2H recovery seems unlikely, these dynamics force us to reconsider the downside case for MU especially considering our long-term bullish demand view."" He thinks that Micron could face some gross-margin pressure next year, as the company's cost-reduction efforts slow, but Arcuri predicts that the company's ""more proactive approach to capacity"" can limit how much the company's margins may fall. Arcuri raised his price target to $60 from $42.

Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar lowered his rating on Sirius XM to underweight from equal weight, and he reduced his rating on the Liberty tracking stock to equal weight from overweight. ""While execution remains exceptional, in our view, we believe the company is now in a much more mature phase of its growth cycle and the story is changing,"" Venkateshwar wrote. ""Meanwhile, the room to buy back more stock is likely to become constrained, M&A may become a bigger priority, margin expansion may become tougher, and competitive pressures are likely to step up."" As for the tracking stock, Venkateshwar said that he still prefers LSXMA over the regular Sirius shares, but he said the NAV discount might close due to Sirius's stock falling, not due to the tracking stock rising. ""It is not surprising that Liberty has been looking at other uses of cash such as iHeart instead of buying more LSXMA stock,"" he said. Sirius shares are up 31% over the past 12 months, while the tracking stock has gained 11%. ",2018-06-26T11:14:00-04:00,"

The choice to fund the account makes the company's class B shares subject to dilution. Baird analyst David Koning wrote Tuesday morning that the funding of the litigation escrow account is essentially the same as a repurchase of about 4.6 million shares, which he estimates could add a cent to the company's annual earnings per share. ""We are not sure what triggered this, as the last similar event occurred in September 2014 (a $450 million escrow funding),"" he wrote. ""For perspective, the company has been repurchasing ~15-18 million shares per quarter, so this ~4.6 million shares doesn't appear to create a big lumpy repurchase event.""

The two companies began collaborating in 2014, and the partnership has produced more than two dozen early-stage programs in areas like oncology and neuroscience. Under the new agreement, Calico -- a 150-employee company based in the Bay Area that focuses on aging research and therapeutics -- will be responsible for research and early development until 2022 and plans to advance projects through phase 2a through 2027. The companies will split costs and profits. Alphabet shares rose 0.3% in premarket trade.

Analyst David Miller set a $503 stock price target, equal to 31% above its current trading level. ""In our view, the greatest competitive advantage Netflix has as it seeks to grow subscribers from current levels in its pricing structure, and the value the consumer receives for that structure,"" Miller wrote in a note. He noted that for just $7.99 a month, consumers can access content across film and TV dating back to the 1960s. The lack of a la carte pricing contrasts with video-on-demand services, which are priced at $3.99 to $5.99 a film. ""In reality, there's not much competition,"" wrote Miller. ""As such, we continue to scratch our heads as to why the detractors on this name keep citing ""competition"" as a reason either to short the stock or sell it prematurely.""

","The first cannabis-derived drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The drug, epidiolex, is intended for seizures associated with two rare types of childhood epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex contains cannabidiol (CBD), as opposed to the psychoactive component of cannabis, THC, but the product remains a controlled substance and can't be sold until the Drug Enforcement Administration makes a final scheduling decision, according to the approval letter. GW Pharmaceuticals shares declined about 1% in Monday midday trade. Approval of the drug has been expected since a favorable FDA advisory committee recommendation in April. As part of the approval, the FDA also granted the company a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, which allows for priority review of a drug; the vouchers have also been sold for hefty sums. ""This is an important medical advance,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Monday announcement. ""But it's also important to note that this is not an approval of marijuana or all of its components. This is the approval of one specific CBD medication for a specific use."" But he went on to warn about ""the proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims,"" including oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas and lotions illegally marketed as treatments or cures for diseases like cancer. GW Pharma shares have surged 29% over the last three months, compared with a 4.8% rise in the S&P 500

A complaint filed by Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin alleges that public filings from the company contained ""material misstatements"" about the company's finances, because it was not making the pension payments. ""Under these pension plans, MetLife was responsible for reserving enough money to make payments to Massachusetts pensioners, whose average age was 72,"" Galvin said in a statement. ""Instead, some reserves were released and became assets which inflated MetLife's bottom line."" The charges come after a probe launched in December 2017, after MetLife acknowledged that it had lost track of tens of thousands of pensioners to whom it owned payments after acquiring their pension obligations from the retirees' employers. Galvin is seeking full payment with interest of the pensions, as well as sanctions, censure and a fine.

The deal, which includes Jenbacher and Waukesha engines along with manufacturing sites in Austria, Canada and the U.S., is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The business is a provider of reciprocating gas engines, or piston engines, power equipment and services based on power generation and gas compression at or near the point of use, GE said. It has $1.32 billion of sales in the year to Dec. 31, 2017. Ge is currently in the midst of a restructuring that aims to sell off $20 billion of assets by the end of 2019. Chief Executive John Flannery is working to boost profitability at the company after years of underperformance. The stock has fallen more than 50% in the last 12 months, leading to its ouster from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a move that will take place at the end of trading today.

                                         sank 4.8% in premarket trade Monday, after the cruise ship operator beat fiscal second-quarter profit expectations, but cut its full-year outlook. Net income for the quarter to May 31 rose to $561 million, or 78 cents a share, from $379 million, or 52 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share rose to 68 cents from 52 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 59 cents. Revenue rose to $4.36 billion from $3.95 billion, just above the FactSet consensus of $4.32 billion, as better-than-expected passenger ticket revenue helped offset a slight miss on onboard revenue. For 2018, the company cut its adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.15 to $4.25 from $4.20 to $4.40, which compares with the FactSet consensus of $4.36.

The agency had opened an inquiry into Zillow's practice of allowing real estate agents and other professionals, like lenders, to share the cost of advertising on its site, in 2017. Regulators were concerned that this practice, called ""co-marketing,"" violated a 1974 rule called the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that keeps service providers from funneling customers to each other in exchange for kickbacks. ""On June 22, 2018, the Company received a letter from the Bureau stating that it had completed its investigation, that it did not intend to take enforcement action, and that the Company was relieved from the document-retention obligations required by the Bureau's investigation,"" Zillow said in an SEC filing. As MarketWatch has previously reported, the acting head of the CFPB, Mick Mulvaney, said in April that he had the legal authority to drop investigations then pending at the CFPB, without having to explain the action.",2018-06-25T09:17:00-04:00,"

                                         shares plummeted nearly 46% in premarket trade on Monday after the company said that a patient had died in the company's ongoing phase 2b clinical trial for its prostate cancer drug topsalysin. The patient death happened the same day that the patient was administered the drug for the second time, the company said. Sophiris is investigating the death and won't administer the drug a second time for any more patients, as a precaution. The phase 2b trial is geared at evaluating how safe and tolerable one dose or, when applicable, two doses of topsalysin are for patients, and was the first such trial designed to allow certain patients to get a second administration of the drug. However, patients had to meet certain criteria, including no significant safety issues related to the drug and evidence of a response to the treatment. Total, 38 patients were enrolled in the trial, and 11 have already received a second dose. The company said that an independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety data, including data on the first seven patients who got a second dose of the drug, in May, and recommended the trial continue without any changes. Topsalysin is also in late-stage development for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Company shares have surged nearly 77% over the last three months, compared with a 6.4% rise in the S&P 500

""Although there was interest in the business, the offers we received did not reflect an appropriate value for this premium brand, and did not meet our expectations,"" Chief Executive Mark Schwabero said in a statement. The low value was mostly due to the weak financial performance of the yacht product category, he said, which ""complicated and obscured"" the value of the rest of Sea Ray.

                                         said Monday a midstage trial of a treatment for pancreatic cancer failed to meet its main goals. The clinical-stage oncology company said results from a Phase 2 trial that added MM-141 to the current treatments for patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer and high serum levels of free Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints. The company said it will not devote any more resources to the development of MM-141, but will continue with two clinical programs, MM-121 and MM-310, with data expected later in 2018.

                                         responded to a lawsuit filed last week by Fujifilm, in response to Xerox backing out of the deal to buy Fujifilm, by saying the internal accounting issues resulting from ""mismanagement"" made it ""impossible"" to close the transaction. ""The lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate and misguided negotiating ploy to save their takeover attempt, which to this day remains enjoined by order of the New York State Supreme Court, and could take our focus away from serving our customers,"" said Chief Executive John Visentin in a letter to Fujifilm Chairman Shigetaka Komori. In an effort to protect its supply chain, Xerox said it will start sourcing products from new vendors, build partnerships with companies aligned with Xerox and will not renew the technology agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires. Last week, Fujifilm sued Xerox for $1 billion, a little over a month after Xerox ended its merger deal. Xerox's stock, which slipped 0.4% in premarket trade, had lost 9.4% year to date through Friday, while Fujifilm's U.S.-listed shares had shed 6.1% and the S&P 500

The company said the cells may have potential as a multi-organ treatment for acute radiation syndrome, or ARS. ""Lethality in ARS originates mainly from radiation-induced injuries to bone marrow and the GI tract, highlighting the importance of the study's purpose and results,"" Akihiro Inano, Ph.D. of Fukushima University, said in a statement.

""The key driver of the margin erosion appears to be 'Services and Maintenance,'"" Sacconaghi wrote, but he and his team ""struggle to find evidence as to why the COGS [cost of goods sold] of Services and Maintenance have increased exponentially...with no commensurate increase in revenues."" He said that Tesla's assertion is that the company is building out services infrastructure, but that doesn't square with Bernstein's figures. ""The worry/key question, of course, is whether COGS that should be (or historically have been) booked in the Automotive Segment are now being booked in the ""Services and Other"" reporting segment, given that investors focus nearly exclusively on Automotive GMs & generally disregard ""Services and Other"" GMs,"" Sacconaghi wrote. He has a market perform rating on Tesla's stock and a $265 price target.

Morgan analyst David Karnovsky raised his price target on the stock to $70 from $46, though he kept his neutral rating intact. Karnovsky's increased target price reflects reports that WWE got higher-than-expected rights fees for Raw and SmackDown. ""The over 3x increase is higher than the 1.8x we had modeled, and relative to our expectation, we underestimated the probability the company would split its properties between networks, an outcome seemingly made possible by Fox Sports prioritizing WWE over UFC,"" he wrote. Karnovsky said a potential step-up in India fees could be one catalyst for the shares, but WWE might also have to increase its costs ""to support Network growth & content localization.""

","An index that tracks U.S. manufacturers and a gauge for service-oriented companies both tapered off slightly in June but still showed the U.S. economy expanding at a strong pace, according to IHS Markit's flash PMIs. The manufacturing index slipped to a seven-month low of 54.6 from 56.5. The services barometer dropped to a two-month low of 56.5 from 56.8. Any number over 50 signifies expansion, and results above 55 are considered exceptional. ""The flash PMI surveys add to evidence that the U.S. economy is enjoying a strong second quarter.

                                         plans to close more than a dozen solar installation facilities across nine states, Reuters reported late Thursday. The closures had not yet been disclosed, but are part of the 9% workforce cuts announced last week, Reuters said. The solar cuts will affect facilities of the former SolarCity, which merged with Tesla in 2016. Citing company documents and sources inside Tesla, Reuters said 13 or 14 solar facilities would close in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arizona and Delaware. About 60 solar facilities remain open. Tesla declined to comment on which facilities would close or how many jobs would be lost, Reuters said.

Police have been notified and actions are being taken to enhance security at the Gigafactory,"" a Tesla spokesman said in response to an email seeking comment on the employee, Martin Tripp. Tripp was accused of sabotage by Chief Executive Elon Musk in an email late Sunday night, and Tesla fired him Tuesday and sued him Wednesday. Tripp, though, spoke to The Washington Post and CNNMoney on Wednesday evening and claimed to be a whistleblower seeking to expose dangerous practices and inaccurate public statements at Tesla.

Feldman argued that the company's ""focus on meeting the FCC's March 2020 build-out requirements"" as well as upcoming spectrum auctions or sales ""that may be more immediate priorities for potential partners"" will hamper the company's ambitions. ""We estimate that intensifying structural headwinds to DISH's satellite TV services will put downward pressure on FCF and upward pressure on net leverage,"" he said.

Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy wrote that he isn't concerned about the leadership transition. ""Although we respect Mr. Krzanich's efforts in redirecting Intel's strategy from a compute-centric to a data centric company, we view Intel as a process-driven company with a deep bench of CEO candidates that can continue to drive the corporate strategy,"" he wrote. ""Somewhat offsetting this negative news, Intel pre-announced June quarter results to the upside, driven by what we expect to be higher margin Data-Center Group revenue.""

                                         edged down with the broader market on Thursday, after Raymond James raised its stock price target by $100 to $465 on strong momentum for its international business and continued growth in the U.S. The new price target is 12% above its current level and comes after a slew of other bullish notes and price target increases this week. ""Media consolidation and the shift to more over-the-top (OTT)/direct-to-consumer models plays to Netflix's strengths (e.g. personalization, year round quality programming, service reliability) and may provide a driver for price increases over time,"" analyst Justin Patterson wrote in a note. Raymond James is expecting Netflix to gain market share around the globe and to retain customers thanks to the depth of its library and pricing power. The company enjoys ""material margin expansion potential,"" and is well-positioned for long-term per-share earnings growth and free cash flow generation, he wrote. The company could have more than 280 million global subscribers by 2024, given the success of shows like the German series ""Dark,"" which had 90% of its viewership outside Germany.

                                         could actually benefit from tariffs on goods between the U.S. and China, according to Wells Fargo analysts.

Wells Fargo estimates that Tiffany's annual earnings per share could get a 10-to-15-cents boost through either margin upside or increases in unit volume. While analysts don't characterize the bump as ""massive,"" it could provide ""insulation.""

Starbucks said Tuesday it is planning to return $25 billion to shareholders through 2020, up from a plan to return $15 billion in 2018. ""The material increase in Starbuck's fixed shareholder return target will result in significantly higher debt levels and weaker credit metrics at a time of operating challenges"" Moody's Senior Credit Officer Bill Fahy said in a statement. ""We estimate that the additional debt needed to fund the proposed shareholder returns will result in leverage exceeding 2.8 times and retained cash flow to total debt of around 20%."" The rating agency is also concerned that Starbucks may be reluctant to curtail shareholder returns if operating results fall short of estimates.

","The Bank of England on Thursday left its key interest rate at 0.5%, meeting widely held expectations. But the vote was 6-3, a change from the bank's prior tally of 7-2 to make no changes in policy. Thursday's decision comes as inflation has slowed to a 2.4% rate but is still above the bank's 2% target. ""Inflation is expected to pick up by slightly more than projected in May in the near term, reflecting higher dollar oil prices and a weaker sterling exchange rate,"" the bank said in a statement.

","Shares in German auto makers fell Thursday as traders assessed a profit warning from Daimler AG as well as the companies' support of a tariffs proposal. Daimler issued a surprise profit warning late Wednesday, saying Chinese retaliatory import duties on vehicles built in the U.S. would hit sales and profits of the SUVs it builds at its Alabama factory. Meanwhile, Daimler, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG have thrown their support behind the abolition of all import tariffs for cars between the European Union and the U.S. in an effort to find a peaceful solution to the brewing trade war.

","The executive board of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday approved a three-year $50 billion loan to Argentina. The board's decision allows officials to immediately access $15 billion, with half of the funds used for budget support. The Argentine government, which asked for assistance in early May, has said it hopes to keep the rest of the funds available only as a precaution. The IMF said that the government's economic plan ""aims to strengthen the country's economy by restoring market confidence via a consistent macroeconomic program that lessens financing needs, puts Argentina's public debt on a firm downward trajectory, and strengthens the plan to reduce inflation by setting more realistic inflation targets and reinforcing the independence of the central bank.""",2018-06-20T13:14:00-04:00,"

The Recode report said that the deal is expected to close this summer and was ""on hold"" until the company's Time Warner deal went through. Recode cites sources familiar with AT&T's plans and said that ""industry observers"" think the deal will give Otter Media a valuation of more than $1 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday that AT&T was also in talks to purchase AppNexus, an ad-tech company.

""Oracle's issues likely go beyond execution: they appear more deeply rooted in more intense competition in the cloud, reliance on a perpetual model, and perhaps cultural inertia."" He said that while Oracle beat expectations in the latest quarter, it likely missed its goals for cloud bookings. The company stopped breaking out its cloud business with the most recent numbers.

","Dr. James Madara, the chief executive of the American Medical Association, wrote to U.S. government officials on Tuesday urging them to stop a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward undocumented immigrants that so far has separated about 2,300 immigrant children from their parents. At a recent policy-making meeting of the U.S.'s foremost doctors group, delegates said the policy ""will do great harm to children and their parents or caregivers, who felt compelled to make a dangerous and uncertain journey because of safety concerns in their own countries,"" Madara wrote in the letter, which was made public early Wednesday. ""Families seeking refuge in the U.S. already endure emotional and physical stress, which is only exacerbated when they are separated from one another. It is well known that childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences created by inhumane treatment often create negative health impacts that can last an individual's entire lifespan."" The Trump administration announced the zero-tolerance policy in early May and views separating children from their families as a deterrent to illegal migrants, according to a report. The policy has been met with condemnation from many critics.",2018-06-20T09:10:00-04:00,"

""We think Alibaba is years ahead of any competitor in driving digital commerce forward,"" Sanderson said. ""Of greater consequence is Alibaba's foray into digitizing offline commerce (New Retail), which we think is even further ahead and has potential to multiply Alibaba's addressable market.""

Martin's channel checks ""suggest a dramatic slowdown of spending by brands on SNAP in 2Q vs 1Q."" She said that the first quarter benefited from key events like the Grammys and the Super Bowl. Martin lowered her daily-active-user projections but raised her profit estimates due to ""aggressive cost cutting."" She has an underperform rating on the stock.

Sally Beauty is taking steps to turn around the business after ""stagnant"" results. ""We see these moves as necessary and prudent for longer-term brand health, but see heightened downside risk in terms of execution in the medium term, particularly in the midst of existing traffic pressures,"" the analyst note said.

","The European Union will begin implementing tariffs on €2.8 billion ($3.2 billion) worth of goods imported from the U.S. on Friday, the European Commission said Wednesday. The ""rebalancing measures"" are in response to the U.S. imposing respective tariffs of 25% and 10% on aluminum and steel imports from the EU on June 1, the commission said. Agricultural goods and other U.S. products will also be hit with levies. ""The rules of international trade, which we have developed over the years hand in hand with our American partners, cannot be violated without a reaction from our side. Our response is measured, proportionate and fully in line with WTO rules,"" Cecilia Malmström, the European Union's trade commissioner, said in a statement. The EU may impose tariffs on another €3.6 billion worth of U.S. goods ""at a later stage -- in three years' time or after a positive finding in WTO dispute settlement if that should come sooner.""

                                         jumped more than 10% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company blew past earnings estimates for its fiscal third quarter. The company said it had net income of $32.5 million, or $1.02 a share, in the quarter to May 26, up from $19.4 million, or 61 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $562.3 million from $85.5 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 91 cents and revenue of $541 million. The company, which also makes boats, said net products performed well, while cost savings helped combat inflationary pressures. ""Our new product launches across both segments are performing well, driving healthy backlog increases, and we remain comfortable with our current dealer inventory levels which are supported by our strong retail performance and increases in market share,"" Chief Executive Michael Happe said in a statement. Revenue in the company's towable segment rose 33% to $313 million, while revenue for the motorized segment rose 3.1% to $249 million. The company is expecting continued input cost pressure in the fourth quarter and will continue to work on cost savings. The company will work to integrate Chris-Craft, the marine brand that it acquired after the end of the quarter.

""Today's change to the DJIA will make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market."" The company noted that GE's plunging stock price factored into the decision as well. The change is set to take effect before the market opens next Tuesday, June 26.

The announcement, which was made just before being discussed at an Oppenheimer conference in Boston, said that the plan was developed with goals of accelerating growth in the U.S. and China while ""sharpening the focus on increasing shareholder returns."" ""While certain demand headwinds are transitory, and some of our cost increases are appropriate investments for the future, our recent performance does not reflect the potential of our exceptional brand and is not acceptable,"" Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said. ""We must move faster to address the more rapidly changing preferences and needs of our customers."" Starbucks said it plans to close about 150 company-operated stores ""in its most densely penetrated markets,"" up from an average of 50 annually, while looking to open stores in other markets. Overall, the rate of store growth would slow, the company said. Starbucks hiked its dividend 20%, to a quarterly return of 36 cents a share, and said it plans to return $25 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks through its 2020 fiscal year. Starbucks also said it now anticipates 1% same-store sales growth in the current quarter. Starbucks stock declined by almost 3% in late trading; shares have been flat so far in 2019, as the S&P 500 index

","The Securities and Exchange Commission said it's filed charges and obtained an asset freeze against individuals and companies behind a $102 million Ponzi scheme. According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants defrauded 637 investors and some were guaranteed dividends or double-digit returns. They did this by buying or taking over the books of business of retiring investment professionals. The SEC said the defendants spent at least $20 million to enrich themselves, paid $38.5 million in Ponzi-like payments, and transferred much of the remainder in transactions that appear unrelated to the issuers' purported businesses. The SEC sued Perry Santillo, Christopher Parris, Paul Anthony LaRocco, John Piccarreto, Thomas Brenner, First Nationle Solution, LLC, Percipience Global Corporation, and United RL Capital Services.

President Donald Trump raised the stakes in the U.S.'s trade conflict with China late Monday, asking his administration to draw up a fresh list of Chinese goods worth $200 billion on which to impose tariffs and promising a fresh $200 billion in tariffs if Beijing retaliates.

Analysts say shares of the toy company's stock have risen more than 35% since March but there's been ""little change on fundamentals."" Moreover, the company now has the additional ""execution risk"" from an ""untested management team and levered balance sheet."" U.S. toy sales grew to $20.7 billion in 2017, which also leads analysts to think Mattel has created its own problems, stalling top-line recovery. ""Because there is no evidence of industry structural declines, we think Mattel's market share losses have largely been self-inflicted,"" wrote analysts led by Arpine Kocharyan.

                                         shares rose nearly 12% in premarket trade on Tuesday after the company said that the Food and Drug Administration had provided guidance on the company's OP-02 drug-device product for otitis media, a type of infection in the middle ear. The company won't need any additional preclinical or clinical studies beyond a planned phase 1 safety study to start phase 2 studies in children, Novus President Catherine Turkel said. Young children are especially at risk of getting these types of infections. Most clear up in a few days, but complications -- though infrequent -- can be serious. Novus has another ear technology, OP-01, but has focused on developing OP-02 since last year. Novus shares have risen 2% over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500

The tit-for-tat warning came after Trump said he would ask his administration to identify to a new list of $200 billion in Chinese goods that would be penalized with tariffs, in addition to the $50 billion already in hand. A spokesperson from China's Ministry of Commerce said China will have no choice but to take comprehensive measures in response to the U.S.'s trade moves, according to Xinhua. ""The trade war waged by the United States is against both the law of the market and the development trend of today' s world.

The CFTC said the bank, from at least Jan. 2007 through Jan. 2012, made false reports and attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar ISDAFix benchmark. Traders openly joked about the manipulation, the CFTC said. According to the CFTC, one trader messaged: ""remember when i moved the screen in 2y[year] spreads at the 11am setting?

President Donald Trump on Friday announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, and Beijing retaliated by targeting high-value American exports. However, many investors view these developments as opening negotiation salvos, as opposed to a prelude to more punitive measures coming from both sides.

""We believe that ten years in conservatorship is quite enough,"" said the group, which included the Community Mortgage Lenders of America, the NAACP, the Leading Builders of America, and more. Under the terms of a 2012 amendment to the 2008 crisis-era legislation that enveloped Fannie and Freddie in government conservatorship, the two must sweep all their quarterly profits to Treasury. In December, Watt struck a deal with Treasury to allow both companies to retain some capital, but most industry participants believe it's not enough to shield the enterprises from a serious downturn. In January, Fannie said it would turn to Treasury for a bailout when changes to the tax laws caused it to write down assets on its balance sheet. Watt, in turn, has deferred to Congress' lead in enacting more comprehensive housing market reforms, which it has failed to do. ",2018-06-18T15:54:00-04:00,"

                                         will reach its target production rate of 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June, but sustained production at that rate may not happen until some point in the third quarter, Instinet analysts said Monday. ""Nonetheless, we see continued, meaningful progress on Model 3 production alongside our expectation for improved gross margins,"" analysts led by Romit Shah wrote in a note. ""This should offer Tesla a chance to achieve its financial targets in 2H18 (such as cash flow positivity and GAAP profitability)."" Instinet is expecting the electric car maker to be free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter and for the second half of the year, Shah wrote in response to a CNBC report that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had told employees that ""radical improvements"" are still needed to hit production goals. Weighing in on a separate report from Second Measure that Telsa Model 3 reservations are growing but 23% were refunded, Shah said he believes the net balance of reservations has remained stable, ""as data suggests that incoming deposits have at least offset a recent acceleration in deposit refund requests in recent months."" The analyst also expects that refunds went to customers seeking lower average selling prices and that the remaining deposits are for higher trims.

""We see further upside in MU shares as the team is executing well in an overall constructive S/D memory environment,"" Sur wrote, referring to supply and demand.

""We believe these are attributable to Samsung, and primarily on the 3D NAND front,"" Ho wrote. ""We remind investors that Samsung has been Lam's largest customer for many years now (going back to the early 2000s when the company began working aggressively with Samsung)."" Ho remains upbeat in his long-term view of Lam, which he rates a buy, and the industry in general. ""We believe that while our 2018 WFE [waber fab equipment] forecast has been lowered, we are still tracking toward a record year (now up +5-6% versus up +10%) and our 2019 WFE forecast has actually been increased due to the timing of the push outs returning the following year,"" he wrote. Ho is also bullish on Applied Materials, which he said has a more balanced customer base than Lam and less exposure to the memory business. ""This recent weakness presents a very attractive buying opportunity for our top large cap stock selection,"" he wrote.

SGT-001 is a gene therapy that aims to improve protein expression for patients with DMD, a rare degenerative disease. The clinical hold was imposed in March and came after the unexpected hospitalization of a patient in the phase 1/2 trial, called Ignite DMD. Solid said the FDA has acknowledged that it has addressed all of its concerns and the company has already started to move toward restarting enrollment in the trial. It is planning to enroll and dose several children before dosing adolescents.

Ziopharm specializes in developing therapies to treat a range of cancers, using Sleeping Beauty, a non-viral approach to genetically modify chimeric antigen receptor (CAR(+) ) and T-cell receptor (TCR(+) ) T cells, which target specific antigens in blood cancers and neoantigens in solid tumors. ""CAR(+) T cells very-rapidly manufactured with the Sleeping Beauty platform for this third-generation trial are designed to co-express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, membrane-bound interleukin 15 and a safety switch,"" it said.

He noted that when a deal was announced in 2014, shares sold off because the terms fell short of investor expectations. As for whether there's the possibility of disappointment this time around upon an official announcement, Katz wrote that there is some risk, but ""we think less risk this time as WWE is much better positioned due to demand from more players for its [programming] & less uncertainty on subs.""

In addition, he said that the company's earnings beat ""really came from below the line items."" Auty raised his price target on the stock to $260 from $235, though he maintained his neutral rating. The stock closed Thursday near $250. Stifel's Tom Roderick also raised his price target, to $275 from $250. ""Adobe's 2Q results were sterling, as typical, with revenue beating consensus by $35mn and EPS beating by $0.12,"" Roderick wrote.

The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources ""involved in the Apple supply chain."" The iPhone X was the first Apple phone to feature an organic-light-emitting-diode (OLED) screen, and these screens tend to be more expensive than LCD ones. Samsung Display Co. is Apple's main OLED supplier, but shares of Universal Display often move on rumors about Apple's display plans.

The company said it expects EPS of $1.46 to $1.50, up from 63 cents a year ago, and above the FactSet consensus of $1.37. The company said earnings are expected to rise from last year because of increased steel shipments and metal spread expansion.

The six, who all moved to Fitbit after working at Jawbone, are accused of violating confidentiality agreements and knowingly possessing trade secrets; they could face sentences of up to 10 years in prison. ""Intellectual property is the heart of innovation and economic development in Silicon Valley,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Alex G. Tse said in a statement. ""The theft of trade secrets violates federal law, stifles innovation, and injures the rightful owners of that intellectual property."" The two San Francisco-based companies had been involved in litigation, which was settled last year, in which Jawbone accused Fitbit of stealing its employees and trade secrets. In an email, a Fitbit spokesperson said a federal administrative law judge ruled in 2016 in a case involving the same people that ""no Jawbone trade secrets were misappropriated or used in any Fitbit product, feature or technology."" Jawbone, which was valued at more than $3 billion in 2014, was liquidated last year. Fitbit shares are up about 30% this year.",2018-06-15T00:04:00-04:00,"

","The U.S. economic outlook is strong, but the tax-and-spend policies make the fiscal stimulus stronger than what has been since the Johnson administration, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday in a report on the U.S. economy. ""The near-term outlook for the U.S. economy is one of strong growth and job creation,"" the IMF said. The IMF identifies risks including higher public debt, a greater risk of an inflation surprise, international spillover risks, the risk of future recession and increased global imbalances. The IMF added the deficit spending ""will leave few budget resources available to invest in a range of urgently needed supply-side reforms, including infrastructure spending, that would raise living standards.""

He has a market perform rating on the stock. Looking at Square's current customer base of merchants and Square Cash app users, Willi estimates that the company has a $9.3 billion revenue opportunity with its subscription and services offerings. However, he thinks the market opportunity is ""much larger"" when taking into account the likelihood that Square's customer base ""will grow substantially over time"" and that the company will add new subscription and services products. ""As such, we are increasingly confident in SQ's ability to drive substantial growth in S&SB revenue for many years to come,"" he wrote.

Online retail sales accelerated relative to the April period, growing 25.8%. Food and clothing were two key categories. ""The NBS [National Bureau of Statistics] noted that sales of communication equipment and household appliances increased 12.2% y/y and 7.6% y/y, respectively, driven by steady income growth in the region,"" Devitt wrote.

In addition to $90 million upfront, the deal makes Sage eligible for additional milestone payments of up to $485 million, as well as tiered royalties on sales in the three countries. Shionogi will also handle clinical development, regulatory filings and commercialization of SAGE-217 for major depressive disorder and any other indications in those countries. Sage is developing SAGE-217 for major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, bipolar depression and insomnia; just this week the company announced plans to expedite U.S. development of the drug in major depressive disorder and postpartum depression, sending the company's shares up. Why, precisely, shares declined on Thursday is unclear; it's possible investors expected a more lucrative deal, or hoped for the company to be acquired entirely. Because of how far along its drug pipeline is, Sage has been viewed by some as a promising acquisition target.

The outlook is also well above sequential first-quarter EPS of $1.10 because of higher selling prices and increased profitability across all steel mill product groups. ""Our improved earnings are the result of much stronger market conditions that we believe have been positively impacted by deregulation, tax reform and higher, stable oil prices,"" the company said in a statement. the stock had gained 1.2% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the S&P 500

Caso refers to his belief that ""most of Apple's revenue is tied to device sales, and growth has stagnated due to rising prices, and demand hasn't been as elastic as hoped.""

Rising gas prices in particular are helping to spur on inflation. Excluding fuel, prices of imported goods advanced a smaller 0.2%, the government said Thursday. The increase in import prices over the past 12 months rose to 4.3% from 3.6%. If fuel is omitted, the increase in import prices over the past year was a more modest 1.9%. Earlier this week, a pair of measures for U.S. consumer and wholesale prices both rose again, underscoring an increase in inflationary pressures that caused the Federal Reserve this week to raise U.S. interest rates for the seventh time since the end of 2015.

GlaxoSmithKline shares rose 2.4% in premarket trade on Thursday after the news. The two late-stage studies, Gemini-1 and Gemini-2, met their primary endpoint at week 48, the company said. It plans to file for regulatory approvals of the two-drug regimen, composed of the drugs dolutegravir and lamivudine, later this year, and also has plans to present full results at an upcoming scientific meeting. Until then, questions remain about the drug's resistance profile, said EvercoreISI analyst Umer Raffat, who noted that there were no numbers in the company's press release.

","The People's Bank of China on Thursday decided not to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, defying expectations that the Chinese policy makers would follow their usual pattern and respond with small hikes to Fed moves. The Chinese central bank's decision to stand pat came as data for May indicated the economy is losing steam, with readings on retail sales and fixed asset investments both missing forecasts.

","Elon Musk's Boring Co. has won a bid to build a high-speed transit link between downtown Chicago and O'Hare International Airport, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday night. The multibillion-dollar bid to fund, build and operate the airport link is a major step in building the credibility of the Boring Co., which previously has been best known for its futuristic ideas and raising funds by selling caps and flamethrowers. Bloomberg said the city may announce the deal as soon as Thursday. Winning the bid means Chicago has exclusive negotiating rights with the Boring Co. for one year. It's not known what technology would be used for the route, though in a November tweet Musk said: ""Electric pods for sure. Rails maybe, maybe not."" The Boring Co. is also seeking to fast-track a plan to build transportation tunnels beneath Los Angeles, and Musk has said he has verbal approval to build an underground hyperloop from New York to Washington.",2018-06-13T23:38:00-04:00,"

","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was likely the swing central banker who moved the projected 2018 interest rate hikes to four moves from three, according to Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer. Powell likely kept his dot at three moves in March in order to keep the median down so as not to rush the process of market adjustment, Reinhart, now chief economist at Standish, said in an interview.

","The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection said it's reached a settlement with South Carolina's Security Group Inc., which is privately held, for allegedly making improper in-person and telephonic collection attempts on consumer installment loans and retail sales installment contracts. The agency said the actions taken included physically preventing consumers from leaving their homes and visiting and calling consumers' places of work while knowing that those contacts could endanger the consumers' employment. The company is barred from certain collection practices, has to correct inaccurate information about consumers furnished to credit-reporting agencies and was fined $5 million. It's the second enforcement action since Mick Mulvaney became interim director of the agency. In a statement, Security Group noted it didn't admit to any of the bureau's claims and said it disagrees with the allegations and ""strongly disputes any wrongdoing.""",2018-06-13T14:29:00-04:00,"

With his price target increase, Terry became the most bullish Netflix analyst among those tracked by FactSet. ""We forecast that 2018 will be the peak negative free cash flow year for Netflix, with revenue growth beginning to outpace content spend growth next year and ahead of significant positive cash generation in 2022,"" Terry wrote. ""While the widening gap between Netflix's growing income statement profits and the increasing cash flow statement deficit has seemingly had little impact on the company's valuation, we do believe that as the gap begins to reverse and Netflix's cash flow inflects positively in the coming years, Netflix shares should benefit."" Terry predicts that the company's content and marketing spending this year will have a positive impact on subscriber additions, particularly in newer markets.

""The lifetime value of Yelp's account base is diminishing by as much as 25% as the business model transitions away from the 12-month contract to non-term or good-'til-cancelled contracts,"" Anthony wrote. He thinks that Yelp will have to spend more to acquire new customers due to its new model, which along with a drop in average revenue per user could crimp the company's model. Anthony isn't as upbeat as other analysts about the company's request-a-quote feature, which he thinks ""is likely to underwhelm bullish expectations and is likely to be cannibalistic to local advertising."" He lowered his price target to $34 from $45, and the new target makes Anthony the most bearish analyst on Yelp's stock among those tracked by FactSet.

                                         soared 9.9% toward a record high in premarket trade Wednesday, after the consulting company reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, and provided an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. Net income for the quarter to April 30 rose to $41.2 million, or 73 cents a share, from $26.9 million, or 47 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents was above the FactSet consensus of 70 cents. Revenue rose to $475.4 million from $406.1 million, beating the FactSet consensus of $469.2 million, as fee revenue growth was only partially offset by increased compensation and benefits. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects fee revenue of $450 million to $470 million, above the FactSet consensus of $430 million. Separately, the company announced a rebranding, including going forward as soley Korn Ferry and ending its sub-brands such Futurestep, Hay Group and Lominger.

The committee voted 11 to four in favor of the system. The FDA does not have to follow an advisory committee's recommendation, but often does. The product, the Incraft AAA Stent Graft System, is a repair technology for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, which occur in the lower part of the body's main artery and can be life-threatening. The aneurisms affect an estimated 1.5 million individuals in the U.S., and account for about 10,000 deaths each year. Though other treatment options exist, Cardinal Health says that its Incraft system is designed for a wide range of patient populations. Cardinal Health shares have dropped 25.9% over the last three months, compared with a 0.8% rise in the S&P 500

The cloud-based provider of tax management services is still offering 7.5 million shares to the public, so the amount the company could raise increased to $172.5 million from $157.5 million. If the underwriters exercise all the options to buy additional shares, the company could now raise up to $198.4 million.

The biopharmaceutical company's stock was halted for news until 7:30 a.m. ET. The company said trial data shows that FLX-787 has clear potential to reduce cramps and spasms in patients with multiple sclerosis and ALS. ""However, recent observations of oral intolerability at the current dose and formulation, in a subset of patients, in both studies, indicate that more formulation and dose-ranging studies are required, which is challenging for the Company based upon our current resources,"" said Chief Executive Bill McVicar. The company said it has decided its best path forward is to assess strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of the company. Flex Pharma said it will reduce its workforce by about 60% as part of a restructuring to cut costs.

                                         Seattle has repealed a tax that would have paid for homeless aid, according to multiple reports Tuesday. Business interests, led by the likes of Amazon and Starbucks, Seattle's largest employers, raised $200,000 in just a few weeks and gathered signatures for a referendum challenging the new tax, according to The Hill. The tax would have targeted the 585 businesses in the city with annual sales over $20 million, and charged a $275-per-employee levy. Seattle's city council expected the tax to raise $47 million that would have been used to fund affordable housing and programs designed to end homelessness. A Chamber of Commerce-funded study said the tax would eliminate 10,000 jobs and cost $3.5 billion in productivity. Amazon stock was up a fraction after hours and closed up 0.6% to $1698.75.

Trading action on Tuesday followed a historic and closely watched meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, which yielded a pact on the denuclearization of the Hermit Kingdom but which was criticized for a lack of specificity. Focus on that meeting gave way to concerns about the outcome of coming central bank meetings including the Fed which concludes on Wednesday and is slated to result in a quarter-point rate hike, leaving benchmark rates at a range of 1.75% and 2%. The European Central Bank's gathering is set for Thursday. ",2018-06-12T16:13:00-04:00,"

Bloomberg said that app developers would sometimes ask users for permission to access their contacts and either sell the contact lists or use them for marketing. One issue with the contact-access practice was that users would be sharing information about their friends and family but those contacts wouldn't be giving their express permission. Apple's new policy doesn't affect information that's already been shared with app developers, and users who revoke an app's contact-access privileges can't get the data back that they've previously shared, Bloomberg said. Apple executives have emphasized the company's stance on privacy in the wake of Facebook Inc.'s

The company is currently launching the Jurassic World VR Expedition, according to Chief Executive Stephen King, with more coming. ""Our plan, as we mentioned before, is to build a library of proprietary VR content that will enable us to capitalize on this opportunity for many years,"" he said, according to a FactSet transcript of the after-hours earnings call. Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom hits theaters on June 21. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey raised its price target to $62 from $54 on increased confidence in same-store sales growth and ""given our view that the June 14 VR launch will be a meaningful sales catalyst, offsetting the expected negative impact from competitive intrusion and cannibalization,"" analysts wrote in a note. SunTrust rates Dave & Buster's shares buy. The arcade-themed restaurant chain also announced that CEO King will retire from the CEO post effective August 5, the end of the second quarter.

The two nominations move to the full Senate, where the timing of a final vote remains unclear. The Fed has been operating with four vacancies on its seven-member board of governors.

Net income for the quarter to April 30 fell to $19.3 million, or 51 cents a share, from $30.1 million, or 76 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.

Same-store sales for grocery and other merchandise fell 0.4%, while the FactSet consensus was for a rise of 2.6%, and the 1.3% decline in prepared food and fountain same-store sales missed expectations of a 2.2% rise.

                                         shares surged 4.5% in premarket trade Tuesday on news that the company met with the Food and Drug Administration and now plans to expedite development of its SAGE-217 drug in two areas of depression, major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. Sage plans one new phase 3 trial in major depressive disorder, which will likely begin in the second half of this year, to support a FDA filing for the indication. It also plans to use an ongoing trial for postpartum depression, for which early results are expected in the fourth quarter, to support another filing. The two trials will look at a short course treatment of the drug, termed ""episodic dosing,"" and how that works to reduce symptoms of depression as compared with a placebo. The faster-than-usual development plan was made possible by a phase 2 trial of SAGE-217 in major depressive disorder, for which Sage released positive results in December. More data about the drug will be gathered through a long-term, open-label study that will follow about 300 patients for six months, and about 100 patients for a year, the company said. SAGE-217 got ""breakthrough therapy"" designation from the FDA in February, which allows for an expedited development path. Sage shares have dropped 17.8% over the last three months, compared with a 0.04% decline in the S&P 500

""With three weeks to go in the quarter, we estimate the company is tracking to something between 30,000 and 35,000 Model 3 deliveries in the quarter versus our prior view of 20,000-25,000."" Erikson raised his second-quarter revenue estimate to $4.37 billion from $3.91 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $4.23 billion. He kept his rating at sector weight, saying the longer-term debate on the electric car maker remains more balanced, but he said ""evidence supporting the bear case is not likely to emerge in the near term, in our view.""

The net loss for the quarter to May 4 was $2.6 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.8 million, or 24 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.

","Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser to President Donald Trump, suffered a heart attack Monday, according to the president. Trump tweeted Monday night: ""Our Great Larry Kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack. He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center."" The White House later said Kudlow was in ""good"" condition and doctors expect him to make a full recovery. Kudlow, 70, is the director of the National Economic Council and was part of the U.S. negotiating team over the weekend at the G-7 meeting in Quebec. During a fiery interview on CNN on Sunday, Kudlow said Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""kind of stabbed us in the back"" after Trudeau reiterated that U.S. tariffs against Canada were ""insulting"" and would result in retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",2018-06-11T22:36:00-04:00,"

RH said it earned $28.1 million, or $1.11 a share, in the first quarter, versus a loss of $3.4 million, or 9 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusted for one-time items, RH said it earned $33.5 million, or $1.33 a share, compared with $1.8 million, or 5 cents a share, a year ago. Sales fell 0.8% to $557 million, from $562 million. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.01 a share on sales of $563 million for the company. ""We articulated at the beginning of the year that we will be managing the business with a bias for earnings versus revenue growth in fiscal 2018,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will restrain ourselves from chasing low-quality sales at the expense of profitability like many in our industry, and instead focus on building an operating platform that will enable us to compete and win over the long term."" RH said it expects adjusted net revenues in a range between $2.53 billion and $2.57 billion, and adjusted per-share earnings between $6.34 and $6.83 for the year. For the second quarter, the company sees revenue between $655 million and $662 million, and adjusted EPS between $1.70 and $1.77. Shares of RH ended the regular trading session up 4.8%.

LaSalle said the bid from Pebblebrook was for LaSalle shareholders to receive for 0.92 common shares of Pebblebrook for each LaSalle share they own, with the option for LaSalle shareholders to receive cash up to 20% of the total consideration. Based on Friday's closing price of $40.44 for Pebblebrook's stock, the bid would be valued at $37.20, which would give LaSalle a market capitalization of about $4.11 billion. On May 21, LaSalle agreed to be bought by Blackstone for $33.50 a share in cash. In April, LaSalle said it had received an unsolicited buyout bid from Pebblebrook, in which LaSalle shareholders would received 0.9085 Pebblebrook shares for each LaSalle share they owned.

                                         tumbled 12% toward a 19-month low in morning trade Monday, after the automotive seating company cut its fiscal 2018 outlook and said Chief Executive Bruce McDonald was stepping down, effective immediately. McDonald has led the company since its separation from Johnson Controls International PLC, which was completed in October 2016. Adient said its operating performance is ""running behind plan."" As a result of lower earnings, increased cash restructuring and a negative working capital trend, the company cut its outlook for fiscal 2018 free cash flow to zero to $100 million from about $225 million and its guidance for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to $1.25 billion from $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. To succeed McDonald, Adient named Frederick Henderson interim CEO, while the company searches for a permanent replacement, and John Barth as interim chairman. Henderson was most recently CEO of SunCoke and Barth is currently Adient's lead director.

In a study of 261 healthy adults with herpes simplex virus type 2, aged 18 to 50, with a self-reported history of 4 to 9 recurrences a year, Vical said the annualized recurrence rate in the placebo group was ""far less"" than what was expected, meaning there was ""significantly less power"" to show a vaccine effect in the trial. ""We are extremely disappointed with the outcome and based upon these results, we will be terminating the HSV-2 program,"" said Chief Executive Vijay Samant. Vical said it will remain focused on antifungal VL-2397, which is in a phase 2 trial. The stock had tumbled 30.3% over the past 12 months, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF

Facebook stock was down 0.5% after hours. Known as ""whitelists,"" the deals gave this group of companies access to information about users' friends, including phone numbers and an internal Facebook data point known as ""friend link"" that measures how close users are with one another. The agreements were with companies such as the Royal Bank of Canada and Nissan Motor Co. and demonstrate that Facebook doled out access to more firms than was previously reported. It raises questions about the total number of firms and people who has access to the data of the more than two billion Facebook users, according to the Journal. The Menlo Park, Calif. company said it had made several deals after 2015 to ""improve the user experience,"" test new features and allow some of the partners to ""wind down"" existing projects, the Journal said.

""Growth in the two key metrics, customers and average revenue per customer, continued along the path shown in recent quarters and that produced a material upside to numbers in the quarter as the leverage in the business shined,"" wrote J.P.

William Blair analyst Justin Furby, who rates the stock at outperform but doesn't have a price target on it, also cheered the company's latest results. ""Demand in the international markets remains healthy, and management called out seeing an acceleration in some of the civil law countries that it targets,"" he wrote.

","About 1,600 immigration detainees are being transferred to federal prisons as part of the Trump administrations crackdown against illegal immigration, Reuters reported Thursday. It is the first large-scale use of prisons to hold those detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Detainees will be held in five federal prisons while they await civil court hearings, Reuters reported. A number of prison-guard union leaders told Reuters the move was unexpected and they had little time to prepare for the detainees. About 52,000 people were arrested illegally crossing the U.S. border in April, and the Trump administration has said it intends to prosecute all of them, as well as to separate children from their parents.

The stock had been on a six-day winning streak, gaining 46% in that time following the company's strong earnings report and its customer conference. Zuora makes tools that help companies adopt subscription business models. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky pumped the brakes on the Zuora enthusiasm, writing that while there were some encouraging signs at the conference, which wrapped up Wednesday, there are also some reasons for caution. ""We didn't pick up meaningful interest or adoption of newer add-on products such as Zuora CPQ and Zuora Insights,"" Zlotsky wrote.

The stock's last six-day winning streak came in September. Fitbit announced at the beginning of the week that it had sold more than a million Versa smartwatches since mid-April. The company's announcement yesterday that CFO Bill Zerella would be stepping down didn't hurt the stock's rally. ""We do not expect Fitbit CFO Bill Zerella's departure to create waves,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote Wednesday. ""We think it was a good choice on the part of management to clearly state in its press release that Zerella is leaving to join an autonomous vehicle startup, indicating that there were no internal issues driving his departure."" Reese rates the stock at neutral with a $6 target price. Morgan Stanley analyst Yuuji Anderson reiterated his underperform rating and $4 target Thursday, writing that while his latest channel checks showed momentum for the Versa, they also indicated ""accelerated declines in older products.""

According to data downloaded from the vehicle, Autopilot, Tesla's suite of advanced driver-assistance systems, was on, including in the minutes immediately before the crash, the report said. The car made alerts to the driver to place his hands on the steering wheel more than 15 minutes prior to the crash. During the minute before the accident, ""the driver's hands were detected on the steering wheel on three separate occasions, for a total of 34 seconds; for the last six seconds prior to the crash, the vehicle did not detect the driver's hands on the steering wheel,"" the NTSB said. The Model X had been following a lead vehicle a few seconds before the crash, but shortly before the car began a left steering movement while following the lead vehicle, the report said. ""At 3 seconds prior to the crash and up to the time of impact with the crash attenuator, the Tesla's speed increased from 62 to 70.8 mph, with no precrash braking or evasive steering movement detected,"" the NTSB said. The investigation is ongoing, it said. Tesla shares were up 0.2% on Thursday, a day after closing at their best since mid March and on the heels of the company's annual shareholder meeting, in which company proposals were approved by large margins and little dissent was aired.

The company had previously announced that it was investigating accounting treatment of certain sales and distribution practices. The company has concluded that it will restate results for years ended 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the results of the first three quarters of 2017. MiMedx said it was withdrawing all prior financial guidance. Separately, MiMedx said former CFO Michael Senken has left the company, effective Wednesday, after 8 1/2-years in the role. Edward Borkowski was appointed interim CFO, effective immediately, until a permanent replacement is found.

                                         said Thursday it has entered an exclusive option agreement with TMS Co. Ltd. to acquire its TMS-007 treatment for acute stroke. The company said it will pay $4 million upfront and an additional $18 million once the option is exercised, as well as milestone payments of up to $355 million and tiered royalties. ""TMS-007 is a plasminogen activator with a novel mechanism of action associated with breaking down blood clots, and is believed to inhibit local inflammation at the site of thrombosis,"" Biogen said in a statement. The drug has the potential to extend the treatment window compared with current thrombolytic agents, it said. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. TMS-007 has demonstrated an adequate safety profile in an early stage trial and is being evaluated in a phase 2 study in Japan. Biogen shares were slightly higher premarket, but are down 3.7% in 2018, while the S&P 500

                                         surged 2.8% in premarket trade Thursday, after Evergreen Parent LP raised its bid to buy the shares that the Karfunkel-Zyskind family down already own or control to $14.75 a share from $13.50 a share. Evergreen Parent is an entity formed by the Karfunkel-Zyskind family and private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital LLC. Barry Zyskind is the insurance services company's chairman and chief executive. The new bid, which is 9.3% above the previous agreed upon price in March, values AmTrust at about $2.95 billion. ""The amended agreement follows significant engagement with our public stockholders, and is consistent with our commitment to maximize value for public stockholders,"" said Don DeCarlo, chairman of the special committee. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 3.5% of AmTrust's shares outstanding, reached a settlement with the buyers and agreed to support the deal and waive appraisal rights and other claims.

                                         soared 21% in premarket trade Thursday, after the company topped earnings estimates for its fiscal first quarter to April 30. The company said it swung to a profit of $12.7 million, or 39 cents a share, from a loss of $2.6 million, or 8 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 40 cents, well ahead of the FactSet consensus of 27 cents. Sales rose to $358.4 million from $355.8 million, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $355.0 million. ""Fiscal year 2019 is off to an excellent start,"" Chief Executive Norm Miller said in a statement. The company said it has positive same-store sales for April, the first positive month of same-store sales in more than two years. ""Retail results benefited from record first quarter retail gross margin,"" he said. ""Credit performance strengthened during the quarter, and our credit segment had its first quarter of operating income in four years. With our credit platform on a clear path towards improved financial results, we continue to focus on driving sustainable growth in our highly profitable retail segment.""

                                         tumbled 7.1% toward a 3 1/2-year low in premarket trade Thursday, after the food and beverage company reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and provided a downbeat earnings outlook. Net income for the quarter to April 30 rose to $185.9 million, or $1.64 a share, from $110.4 million, or 96 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 missed the FactSet consensus of $2.19. Sales slipped to $1.781 billion from $1.784 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $1.80 billion, as declines in the oils, peanut butter and baking categories, which was partially offset by gains in coffee, led to lower volume and mix. For fiscal 2019, the company, which brands include Smuckers, Folgers, Crisco and Kibbles 'n Bits, said it expects adjusted EPS of $8.40 to $8.65, below the FactSet consensus of $9.18.

","S&P Global Ratings lowered Murray Energy's debt rating to CC, one step from default, saying that the agreement between the coal producer and some of its lenders to complete a private exchange is ""tantamount to a default."" That private offer would exchange about 71% of the company's $996 million in 11.25% secured notes due in 2021 for newly issued 12% senior notes due in 2024, S&P said. In addition, maturity of $1.8 billion in outstanding term loans would be extended to 2022 from 2020. The offer implies that investors will receive less value than the promise of the original securities, and ""the offer is distressed, rather than opportunistic,"" S&P Global said. The ratings agency also placed all Murray's ratings on ""CreditWatch with negative implications, reflecting our expectation that we will lower the corporate credit rating to 'SD' (selective default) and the issue-level ratings, subject to the exchange offer, to 'D' once the transaction is completed,"" S&P Global said. Murray and two other mining companies were among the few U.S. concerns that lauded President Donald Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord last year.

                                         shares fell 7% late Wednesday after the RV maker reported fiscal 2018 third-quarter per-share earnings above Wall Street expectations and sales that came in line with forecasts but mentioned ""headwinds"" due to U.S. steel tariffs. Thor said it earned $133.8 million, of $2.53 a share, in the quarter, compared with $111.2 million, or $2.11 a share, in the year-ago period. Net sales rose 12% to $2.25 billion, from $2 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $2.42 a share on sales of $2.25 billion. Labor costs have moderated, but Thor is going through ""inflationary price increases in certain raw material and commodity-based components due in large part to the headwinds created by the announcement and implementation of the steel and aluminum tariffs and other regulatory actions, as well as higher warranty costs,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will continue to manage these input factors through a combination of strategic actions and believe, over time, we will be able to offset these cost increases.""

Consumer Products, has been on a leave of absence since the end of March. She was named president of DC Entertainment in 2009, where she oversaw the development of television projects, feature films and video games, though results have been mixed. DC has struggled to keep up with competitor Marvel; although ""Wonder Woman"" was a critical and commercial hit, critics panned ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" and ""Justice League"" performed below expectations at the box office.

","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday terminated all members of the organization's consumer advisory board and two others and told the dismissed board members that they could not re-apply to those positions. The dismissals came just two days after multiple consumer advocates had spoken out publicly over their concerns that Mulvaney was sidelining the board and shifting the focus of the bureau away from protecting consumers. The step is a confirmation that Mulvaney ""is only interested in obtaining views from his inner circle, and has no interest in hearing the perspectives of those who work with struggling American families,"" said Ann Baddour, a director with the public-interest organization Texas Appleseed who served as the consumer advisory board chair. In a statement, several members of the terminated board noted, ""Federal law requires that the CAB be a well-balanced entity in terms of point of view and that it not be 'inappropriately influenced by' the Bureau director. Any other composition goes against the standards of the law."" The CFPB issued a statement saying, ""By both right-sizing its advisory councils and ramping up outreach to external groups, the Bureau will enhance its ability to hear from consumer, civil rights, and industry groups on a more regular basis.""",2018-06-06T14:38:00-04:00,"

Alphabet class A shares are down 0.9% in mid-afternoon trading and closed at $1,151.02 Tuesday. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, is expected to announce the fine within several weeks but the exact size of the fine wasn't clear, according to anonymous sources cited by the FT. The EU usually issues fines on the lower end of the $11 billion spectrum, according to the FT. The EU announced the antitrust case in 2016 and accused the advertising giant of imposing licensing conditions for the Android OS that favored Google's products and apps over rivals. The EU argued that these activities, among others, amounted to making it more difficult to develop competing web browsers and other operating systems, which ultimately would reduce innovation and give consumers fewer choices. Alphabet has denied the charges. The EU also has investigated Google's comparison shopping business, which resulted in a €2.4 billion fine.

Osha cut his rating to market underpeform, after being at market outperform since May 2017. He also slashed his stock price target by 47% to $46, which is 15% below current levels. The stock has now plummeted 20% this month, as trade talks between the U.S. and China continued over the weekend amid threats of tariffs from both sides. Osha said that while First Solar has done ""a superb job"" of positioning itself for a large-scale transition in solar panel manufacturing, he believes recent policy developments in China will likely put pressure on margins past 2019. The policy change is China's National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) has cut feed-in-tariffs for utility-scale and distributed-generation projects by about 8 cents per kilowatt hour, and has removed its previous target of utility-scale installations and eliminated new utility-scale permits for now.

","Kelly Sadler, the Trump administration communications aide who reportedly mocked Sen. John McCain's brain cancer, no longer works at the White House, according to reports late Tuesday. Last month, Sadler came under fire for reportedly saying, in regards to McCain's opposition to CIA director nominee Gina Haspel, ""It doesn't matter, he's dying anyway."" She did not apologize for her comment, and the White House did not condemn it. ""Kelly Sadler is no longer employed within the Executive Office of the President,"" White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement Tuesday, CNN reported. It was unclear if Sadler resigned or was fired, and also unclear whether she had another job within the administration or had left entirely. Citing sources, the New York Times reported that Sadler did not leave her job because of the McCain comments, but because of friction with White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp.",2018-06-05T23:05:00-04:00,"

Baird analyst Ben Kallo reiterated his outperform rating on the stock and said news that Tesla expects to achieve positive GAAP net income and cash flow in the third and fourth quarters was a highlight. ""While we do not model GAAP profitability for conservatism, we believe TSLA will be able to achieve sustainable operating cash flow and operating profit in the intermediate-term, which would be a significant catalyst, in our opinion,"" Kallo wrote in a note. Shareholders approved the re-election of the board of directors by a significant margin, ""which we believe provides a vote of confidence in management,"" he wrote.

He sees ""less room for error going forward"" for the company, which makes chips that are used for video hardware. ""With dual pressure on sales and gross margin in the mid-term and few sign of recovery in wearable and drone markets, we believe it is more prudent to stay sidelined until we see substantial growth catalysts such as design win of CV22,"" Uerkwitz wrote, a reference to a processor in the company's computer-vision family.

                                         rose 8% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company beat estimates for its fiscal first quarter to May 5. The company said it had a net loss of $496.6 million, or $8.48 a share, in the quarter, after earnings of $78.5 million, or $1.03 a share, in the year-earlier period. The number was weighed down by a non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill and intangibles, a loss recognized on held for sale non-prime receivables and restructuring charges, the company said. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 10 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus for a loss of 9 cents a share. Revenue rose to $1.48 billion from $1.40 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $1.40 billion. Same-store sales were flat. ""Looking ahead, we expect second quarter revenues to be impacted by a tougher prior year same store sales comparison and calendar shifts,"" Chief Executive Virgina Drosos said in a statement. ""We are maintaining our full year 2019 guidance and are intensely focused on laying the foundation to support improved performance in the holiday season."" The company is still expecting fiscal 2019 same-store sales to be down in the low to mid single digits. Sales are expected to range from $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and adjusted per-share earnings are expected to range from $3.75 to $4.25.

The notes will be offered to qualified institutional investors. The company expects to use some of the proceeds to pay for the convertible note hedge transaction, and the rest for general corporate purposes. The hedge transactions could include privately negotiated transactions to reduce the potential dilution to common stock or offset cash payments depending on what the notes will be converted into.

Expectations for the ECB to normalize its monetary policy had waned in recent months as European economic data was sluggish and political developments in Italy took center stage. Market participants questioned whether the ECB could afford to halt bond buys if the economic recovery was slowing and Italy's government was euroskeptic. But following Tuesday's headlines, expectations for the central bank's actions perked up. The euro last bought $1.1719, up from $1.1699 late Monday in New York.

In a letter to Allergan's board of directors, signed by Appaloosa President and Chief Executive David Tepper and Senator Investment Group Managing Partner Douglas Silverman, the financial firms described Allergan's recent strategic review as underwhelming. ""The token measures outlined in Mr. Saunders' presentation betray the Board and management's desire to cling to a status quo that has produced three years of steadily declining stock performance and a fire-sale market valuation,"" the letter said, going on to question whether acquisitions would really help the company. The firms have previously sent letters to Allergan's board of directors in May and late April. Allergan shares were up 2% in Tuesday midday trade.

","Film producer Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges of rape and sexual assault at a hearing in a New York court, according to media reports. The hearing came after a grand jury indicted Weinstein last week on the first charges brought against him by two women. Dozens more women have accused him of sexual misconduct since allegations were first reported by the New Yorker magazine and New York Times last year, sparking a broader reckoning for men who have harassed women that has caught up celebrities in all walks of life. Weinstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman has challenged the credibility of some of the women involved and Weinstein himself has insisted he did not have non-consensual sex. Brafman said the rape charge is ""absurd"" and said Weinstein had a decadelong, consensual sexual relationship with the victim that continued after the alleged attack, which took place in 2013.

                                         shares slumped 8.5% in Tuesday premarket trading with analysts citing same-store sales and revenue declines in largely bearish notes. Ascena Retail, whose brand portfolio includes Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant, reported a fiscal third-quarter revenue decline and a same-store sales decrease of 3% during after hours on Monday. KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts led by Edward Yruma highlight the 10% same-store sales increase at Justice, Ascena's tween brand for girls, but the value fashion segment, Maurices and DressBarn, reported a 5% decline and a 14% decline respectively. ""The value segment (-9%) was plagued by merchandising challenges and ongoing store traffic declines, while the premium segment (-3%) was challenged by assortment misses in tops,"" KeyBanc writes. The premium segment includes Ann Taylor and Loft. KeyBanc rates Ascena shares sector weight. Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, worries that Ascena brands simply aren't selling what customers want to buy. While the weather was a headwind during the quarter, the company should have been able to achieve growth given higher consumer confidence and spending. ""That Ascena could not do this confirms our view that too much of its business is in the murky middle ground of fashion and delivers neither great value nor great fashionability,"" Saunders wrote. Ascena shares are up nearly 98% for the past year while the S&P 500 index

","U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for the suspension of Venezuela from the Organization of American States, according to a report in The Hill. ""There is no greater challenge [in the Western Hemisphere] today than the full-scale dismantling of democracy and the heartbreaking humanitarian disaster in Venezuela,"" said Pompeo, speaking at the 48th session of the OAS General Assembly in Washington on Monday. Pompeo made the plea following the reelection of President Nicolás Maduro, in a widely condemened presidential vote. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to make the same request at the meeting that stretches into Tuesday, according to a report in The Hill. One consequence of its suspension would be a freeze in aid from the Inter-American Development Bank. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela last month, with Maduro blamed for the downward economic spiral of the country, which is in the grips of a deep recession and hyperinflation.

","Federal prosecutors working with special counsel Robert Mueller on Monday accused Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, of attempting to tamper with witnesses in his trial. In court documents released late Monday, prosecutors said Manafort called and sent encrypted text messages to potential witnesses against him, apparently in an attempt to ""secure materially false testimony"" about Manafort's lobbying practices. Those efforts violate Manafort's court-ordered conditions for release, prosecutors said, and they asked the court to revise the terms of his release or else send him back to jail until his trial begins. Last October, Manafort was indicted on nine counts, including conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to defraud and commit offense against the United States. One trial is set to begin in July, and another in September. The latest filing did not include charges of witness tampering, which could be a separate crime.",2018-06-04T21:18:00-04:00,"

Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa reiterated his underweight rating and stock price target of $11, which is 20% below current levels, saying he still sees the need for the industrial conglomerate to cut its dividend and raise cash in order to ""de-risk substantially."" Last week, Tusa said the company's GE Capital business remained an ""underappreciated risk."" The stock has now tumbled 10% since Chief Executive John Flannery started speaking at an industry conference on May 25, but is still 6.9% above the April 9 nine-year closing low of $12.83. The stock has plunged 21.4% year to date, to be the Dow's worst performer so far this year. Meanwhile, the Dow has gained 0.4% this year.",2018-06-04T16:10:00-04:00,"

So far this year the Silicon Valley car maker has spent almost $150 million on scrap materials, according to the report. In a response to Business Insider, Tesla called the $150 million figure an ""overstatement"" and said that the number was in the millions, but not that high, the report said. The high scrap rates are a normal part of a production ramp, Tesla said. Tesla shares rose 1.7% on Monday, and the shares are up 4.2% this month, compared with a 1.5% gain for the S&P 500 index.

Siri will now be able to suggest that you order coffee from your favorite place at the same time that you normally get your coffee. It will also remind you to call your grandmother on her birthday or draft a suggested text to your boss when it knows you're late to your meeting. There will also be a new Shortcuts app that lets you create voice commands that set off a chain of actions, such as a travel command that easily gives you all of the details for your trip. Apple announced updates to its notifications as well, including an improved do-not-disturb mode that won't tempt you with notifications when you're lying in bed and an ability to group notifications by type. You will also be able to get reports on the amount of time you spend in each app each week and limit yourself to a an hour or so on a given app per day. Parents can set app allowances for their children.

                                         cancer drug Opdivo. Bristol-Myers shares declined nearly 1% premarket. The trial, which tested the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and urothelial cancers, had ""underwhelming"" results, said EvercoreISI analyst Josh Schimmer. ""We remain unconvinced that '214 adds benefit to Opdivo,"" he said. Noting that the companies did not separately present results for ""stage 2"" patients in the trial, he said, ""if new cohort (N2) [overall response rate] doesn't improve substantially with follow up, we expect investors to broadly lose confidence (if they haven't already)."" Drugmakers have been working to combine various cancer treatments in clinical trial to see if the combinations work better than one treatment on its own, and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo is already a blockbuster cancer drug on its own accord. Not all analysts were so gloomy about Nektar's NKTR-214, which is the company's lead immuno-oncology drug candidate and is also being tested on its own and in combination with other drugs, though the Bristol-Myers collaboration is furthest along. The latest results, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, are ""supportive of the long-term potential for NKTR-214 to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 in a number of tumor types,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye, ""but expect near-term volatility based on immature response rate data (not entirely unexpected) that came in on the low end of Street expectations"" and without an update on lung cancer patients. Nektar shares have dropped 43% over the last three months, and Bristol-Myers shares have dropped 22.5%, compared with a 1.6% rise in the S&P 500

Celgene shares declined 0.7%. The trial focused on patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and patients had tried several other treatments before bb2121, with a median of seven prior myeloma treatment regimens. Bluebird shares initially dropped premarket, as expectations were been high for the clinical trial, competition is fierce in this area and Wall Street analysts noted concerns about patients relapsing. ""The current update brings us back to earth,"" Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said. ""BCMA is a good target, but not curative in late lines,"" and he noted that a ""blue-sky hope was (and still is) that BCMA CAR-T would gradually move to early/first line"" as a treatment for the cancer. Bluebird shares have dropped 3.3% over the last three months, and Celgene shares have dropped 12%, compared with a 1.6% rise in the S&P 500

                                         shares surged 8.3% in morning trade Monday after the company released positive results for a phase 1 trial of its cancer drug LOXO-292. The trial included patients with lung cancer, thyroid cancer and pancreatic cancer, all of whose cancers had mutations called RET alterations, which LOXO-292 targets. Patients had high overall response rates, specifically 77% for all RET fusion-positive cancers. ""The durability of both [overall response rate] and stable disease within each of these subgroups remains impressive - and the almost-too-good-to-be-true safety/tolerability profile confirms on-target selectivity while further-distancing LOXO-292 on the competitive differentiation front,"" said Stifel analyst Stephen Willey, increasing Loxo's price target by 18% to $225 and giving the stock a buy rating.

""With the level of recurring revenue now likely to greatly expand, it gives WWE leeway to invest even further in the brand, data, international and localization.""

""We believe that with our local market knowledge and retail expertise we can position the company to generate significant results and reach new levels of success in Brazil,"" Advent said in a statement. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Walmart said it expects to book a non-cash net loss of about $4.5 billion in the second quarter. Most of the loss is due to the recognition of cumuative forex losses and the final loss could be different depending on how the real performs up to the date of close. Walmart is expecting the deal to close this year and does not expect any material impact on per-share earnings.

                                         rose 0.3% in premarket trade Monday, after SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali raised his price target on the e-commerce giant for the fourth time this year, citing a higher expected contribution to earnings and margins from private label sales. Squali lifted his target to $2,000 from $1,900, while reiterating the buy rating he's had on the stock since Aug. 15, 2017. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by FactSet, there are now eight price targets of at least $2,000. Squali's price target has now increased 57% from the year-end 2017 target of $1,270.""With our tracking showing acceleration of house brand launches in early [Fiscal 2018], we continue to believe that private label is a highly under-appreciated trend, and one that should improve the user experience, grow retention and drive incremental revenue and EPS,"" Squali wrote in a note to clients.

The company said a new analysis of four-year data for Keytruda from a Phase 3 study showed that 86% of patients were progression-free 20 months after completing two years of Keytruda. Five-year data from a Phase 1 trial showed the overall survival rate was higher than 40% in treatment-naive metastatic melanoma patients, the longest follow-up for the drug so far. Melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and is behind most skin cancer deaths.

                                         disclosed Monday that it now expects second-quarter revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline about 3% from a year ago. That compares with the air carrier's previous guidance range of a decline of 1% to a decline of 3%. The stock was still inactive in premarket trade. Southwest said the new outlook is primarily a result of lower bookings, largely because of reduced marketing efforts following the Flight 1380 accident, in which an in-air engine rupture led to a passenger fatality. Separately, given lighter revenue trends and higher oil prices, Southwest revised its second-quarter growth outlook for available seat miles, or capacity, to 3.5%, from previous guidance of 3.5% to 4.0%. For the second half of the year, the company expects capacity growth of about 6%, down from previous forecast of the low-7% range.

The company said in the filing that if it does not obtain a capital injection by August it will be forced to restructure the business.

The underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Allen & Co., Credit Suisse and UBS. Private investors last valued Domo at $2 billion in 2015, according to The Wall Street Journal. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission says the company plans to raise $100 million, though that figure is often a placeholder and will increase as Domo approaches its listing date.

","The Federal Reserve doesn't necessarily have to pause once it raises interest rates to ""neutral,"" said San Francisco Fed President John Williams on Friday in an interview with Reuters. Several Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have suggested the Fed might want to take a break when they get rates up to neutral. But Williams might decide to drive rates into restrictive territory if the economy remains strong and inflation is at or above the Fed's 2% target. A voting member this year, Williams will take over the leadership of the New York Fed later this month. He said the Fed might roughly get to neutral after three more rate hikes.",2018-06-01T16:37:00-04:00,"

Truck sales rose 9.4%, with F-Series sales up 11.3% and Transit sales up 12.4%, while E-Series sales dropped 27.5%. SUV sales increased 0.5%, as a 13.7% rise in Lincoln brand SUVs to 7,295 vehicles offset a 0.7% decline in Ford brand SUVs to 74,406 vehicles. Car sales tumbled 13.3%, with Ford branded car sales losing 11.7% and Lincoln brand sales tumbling 36.5%.

""We think the World Cup can be a more meaningful driver for Twitter than in 2014,"" wrote Sanderson, who said that the World Cup brought in roughly $24 million in incremental revenue that year. Sanderson sees greater opportunity in the 2018 World Cup given that Twitter's platform is improved, Fox Sports will likely post all goals to Twitter shortly after they take place, and international revenue is a more important driver of Twitter's business now than it was four years ago.

Tandon is one of three analysts who's assigned Square's stock a $65 price target, the highest target on Wall Street among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Square on Thursday raised its revenue forecast for the second quarter and full year, based on its recently completed acquisition of Weebly, but lowered its full-year adjusted EPS forecast. Tandon wrote that ""higher estimates and increased confidence in the upside case"" caused him to raise his price target. ""We see Square's continued success in penetrating the large TAM, moving up-market, cross-selling multiple products, and the inherent operating leverage in the model driving sustained upside results,"" he wrote.

The company had already said on its May 5 earnings call that it expected the negative opinion. Sarepta said it will now ask for a re-examination of the opinion, which would result in the assignment of a new rapporteur and co-rapporteur. ""The company will also request a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on DMD be called so that neuromuscular specialists, experienced with working with treatments for these patients, can provide expert guidance and insight into, among other things, the validity of the external controls used and the importance of certain functional endpoints, including for instance, the relevance of meaningful slowing pulmonary decline in patients with this difficult to treat disease,"" the company said in a statement. In February, Sarepta halted a trial of its golodirsen therapy due to ""one serious adverse event"" that it said might be related to the therapy, also used to treat DMD.Exondys was approved for use in treating DMD in the U.S. in 2016, in a decision viewed as controversial because it came despite a negative opinion from an advisory committee. It was the first treatment for the disease. DMD patients lack the protein dystrophin, which is critical to muscle function. The disorder, which is rare, mostly affects boys and typically kills patients before the age of 30.

                                         said Friday its shareholders have approved a new program to buy back up to 10% of the plastics and chemicals company's outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on Thursday's stock closing price of $112.12, and 392.1 million shares outstanding as of April 24, the buyback could be valued at $4.4 billion. Separately, shareholders approved the plan to transition to a unitary board of directors from a dual board structure, and the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.00 a share, to be payable Jun 18 to shareholders of record on June 11. The current dividend rate implies a dividend yield of 3.57% at Thursday's stock closing price, compared with the yield on the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF

                                         was downgraded Friday by S&P Global Ratings, which cited concerns over the German lender's restructuring plans. The ratings agency cut the long-term issuer credit rating to 'BBB+' from 'A-'on the bank and its core operating subsidiaries. The troubled bank last week announced plans to cut thousands of jobs in a bid to overhaul its operations and cut costs, but S&P said they see ""significant execution risks in the delivery of the updated strategy amid a continued unhelpful market backdrop, and we think that, relative to peers, Deutsche Bank will remain a negative outlier for some time,"" in a statement. Investors also demanded the resignation of the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, at the Annual General Meeting last week. Shares have tumbled 42% so far this year. The agency kept a stable rating on the bank's outlook, saying that management will execute the plan over time and achieve longer-term objectives. Meanwhile, Australia's consumer watchdog on Friday announced that it would be bringing criminal cartel charges against Deutsche Bank, Citigroup Inc. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. Shares of Deutsche Bank opened up 1.5%, bouncing off a 7% drop Thursday, which came after the Federal Reserve designated the German lender's U.S. business in ""troubled condition,"" people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.",2018-06-01T03:13:00-04:00,"

The stock recently changed hands at $58.51, which was just above the March 14 record close of $58.49. Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps initiated Zillow with a buy rating and price target of $65, which was 11% above current levels. ""We envision a future when Zillow evolves into more of a commerce platform, progressing from its current role as a media property and moving gradually closer to enabling direct transactions,"" Ripps wrote in a note to clients. In the near term, the tailwinds Ripps sees include the continued structural shift online, ad pricing expansion and its homes division, which has potential to provide upside to expectations for the next 2-to-3 years.

The company said the buyback program was increased to 2.0 million shares, and extended to May 31, 2021. The new program could represent up to 8.8% of the shares outstanding. The previous program, which expired on April 23, 2018, was for the repurchase of 1 million shares. The company had bought back 5,860 shares during the fiscal second-quarter ended April 30 for about $754,400, and had repurchased 32,807 shares during the first quarter ended Jan 31 for about $4.85 million.

Jung allegedly made $140,000 in profits trading in advance of public announcement of market-moving events using an account held in the name of a friend living in South Korea, Sungrok Hwang, who is charged as a relief defendant that will be required, if the SEC prevails, to disgorge illicit gains that Jung generated in his account. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York also filed criminal charges against Jung in Thursday. The SEC's complaint alleges that Jung used his friend's account in an attempt to evade Goldman Sachs' requirements that he pre-clear his trades and use an approved brokerage firm that would have reported the trading to his employer. In its press release an SEC official said that the regulator used data analysis to uncover a suspicious trading pattern that could be traced back to Jung.",2018-05-31T13:08:00-04:00,"

Madrigal Pharma's therapy, MGL-3196, showed statistically significant results for several endpoints at week 36, the company said. The therapy was also found to have met a primary endpoint at 12 weeks, in December. NASH, characterized by too much fat stored in the liver, liver inflammation and liver damage, can lead to liver scarring, permanent liver damage or liver cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. Affecting about 3% to 12% of U.S. adults, NASH has become a research target for many pharmaceutical companies, which see it as a lucrative disease area.

","Moody's Investors Service revised its 12 to 18-month outlook for the U.S. steel sector to positive from stable, citing a range of factors, including reduced imports following the news from the White House Thursday that it is imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports from Canada, Mexico and EU. Improved demand levels from 2017 have continued in 2018, said Moody's senior vice president Carol Cowan, the lead author of a new report. Capacity utilization stood at 75.7% in the week to may 19, above the 73.7% level at the same time last year, she said. ""We expect capacity utilization to range between 73% and 77% in 2018,"" said the report. ""While that is below the sustained 80% or higher mark we use as one of the triggers for a positive outlook, we expect continued improvement as markets remain strong and import levels start to recede following final rulings on Section 232 import tariffs and exemptions."" Steel prices are holding at levels that will allow producers to be solidly profitable and to generate cash flow, said Cowan.

                                         swung higher in premarket trade Thursday, as upbeat revenue growth guidance on the post-earnings conference call offset an earnings miss. The stock sank as much as 9.6% ahead of the open soon after fiscal second-quarter results were reported at 7:00 a.m. ET, then started climbing sharply after the conference call with analysts started at 8:30 a.m., and was last up 1.5%. Chief Financial Officer James Moylan said on the call fiscal 2018 revenue growth was expected to be 7% to 9% over a year ago, according to a transcript provided by FactSet. ""You will note that this is up significantly from our previous guidance, and it clearly shows that number and the size of opportunities to take market share that we are seeing,"" Moylan said. The FactSet consensus for 2018 revenue of $2.95 billion implies 5.2% growth. Moylan said the pressure seen on gross margin is because the company is taking advantage of opportunities to grab market share. Over the past three months, Ciena's stock has gained 3.8% through Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite

                                         tumbled 7.8% in premarket trade Thursday, after the discount retailer reported fiscal first-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations and cuts it earnings outlook, citing unfavorable weather, rising freight costs and a calendar shift. Net income for the quarter to May 5 fell to $160.5 million, or 67 cents a share, from $200.5 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as debt refinancing costs, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.19, below the FactSet consensus of $1.23. Revenue rose 5.0% to $5.55 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $5.56 billion.

The company said net income swung to a profit of $500,000, or 1 cent a share, after a loss of $2.7 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $479.4 million from $474.2 million. The FactSet consensus was for a loss per share of 2 cents and sales of $460 million. Same-store sales rose 1%. Gross margin improved by 200 basis points to 29.9% of sales, compared with 27.9% a year ago. ""Comparable sales grew for the first time since late 2015, and for the second consecutive quarter we expanded our gross margin and increased earnings relative to the prior year,"" Chief Executive David Kornberg said in a statement. The company is now expecting second-quarter same-store sales to be down 1% to up 1% and for EPS to range from a loss of 2 cents to earnings of 2 cents. For all of fiscal 2018, it expects same-store sales to range from a decline of 1% to a gain of 1% and for EPS of 37 cents to 47 cents. The FactSet consensus is for second-quarter same-store sales to be flat and EPS to come in at 2 cents. For the full year, the consensus is for same-store sales to be down 0.2% and for EPS of 41 cents.

On Wednesday, Reuters reported that recent output cuts would remain in place. On Sept. 28, 2016, crude oil futures had rocketed 5.3% after OPEC had agreed on the need to cap crude production.

Degrees will be offered through the University of Florida, Brandman University and Bellevue University. Walmart estimates the contribution from their workers at the equivalent of $1 per day. The retailer will subsidize the cost of tuition, books and fees. Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead retail analysts, calls the program one more way that Walmart is investing in its employees. ""In combination with increased pay, training, and improved career opportunities, Walmart is recognizing the positive impact across the board of a stable workforce, and increases the pressure on other companies inside and outside of retail as this heats up the competition for quality employees,"" he wrote.

                                         maker of a colon cancer test, had shares surge 11% in extremely heavy Wednesday trade after the American Cancer Society recommended screening for colon cancers starting five years earlier, at age 45. Colon cancers, which begin in the colon or rectum, are the second leading U.S. cancer killer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and screenings can catch precancerous growths early. The ACS said that its new recommendation, published on Wednesday, was a ""qualified"" recommendation, meaning that there is evidence of benefit but less certainty about the benefits relative to the harms. The group continues to strongly recommend that adults ages 50 years and older get regularly screened, the frequency of which depends on the test used. Because the ACS recommendation was qualified, not strong, it may not translate to other national recommendations. For Exact Sciences, ""we see this event as only directionally positive and unlikely to become reality in the near-term,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Puneet Souda. ""Still, ACS had a larger loudspeaker and the message is more likely than not to catalyze action at other guiding societies,"" Souda said. Colon cancer screening tests include stool-based tests, such as Exact Sciences' Cologuard, as well as exams like a colonoscopy. Exact Sciences shares have surged 31% over the last three months, compared with a 0.5% rise in the S&P 500

Braking distances had been one of the sticking points for Consumer Reports in not bestowing the Model 3 its recommendation last week. Tesla had said it would be able to make adjustments with over-the-air updates, and it did so within days. The improved braking distances raised the Model 3's overall score enough to earn the recommendation, Consumer Reports said. The magazine has other concerns about the sedan, such as wind noise and uncomfortable rear seats, that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said already have been addressed, so Consumer Reports is renting another Model 3 from Tesla to see if the changes made a difference and will update its review, the magazine said. Tesla shares have lost 6.5% this year, versus a 1.8% gain for the S&P 500 index.

                                         strengthened further Wednesday midday trade in New York, following a Reuters report (Reuters via New York Times) indicating that Italy's 5 Star Movement was calling for the withdrawal of Paolo Savona as the antiestablishment party's pick to be economic minister. The populist 5 Star party has been trying to form a government with the right-wing League party, but Italian President Sergio Mattarella rejected their pick of euroskeptic Savona on Monday. Should the parties be unable to resolve the issue, Italy will likely returned to the polls in the coming months to conduct a fresh election. Fear of this outcome had dragged the euro to a 10-month low, as Italian bond yields, which move inversely to prices, shot to a high of 3.3%. The euro last fetched $1.1657, up 1.1% according to FactSet, and the 10-year note

Amobi said reports that WWE agreed to license its ""SmackDown"" programming to Fox broadcast network starting in October 2019, as part of a five-year licensing pact reportedly worth $1 billion, ""could portend a potentially significant upside to its current licensing pact with the NBC network.""

The central bank left interest rates unchanged -- as expected -- with the key overnight rate at 1.25%. The bank's statement took note of ""ongoing uncertainty about trade policies"" that weighed on global business sentiment. The update also indicated that global economic activity remained broadly on track. Canadian inflation should soon be on the rise thanks to higher gasoline prices, first-quarter growth was stronger than expected and exports had been more robust than forecast.

China was a major reason for the industry's decline last year and IDC projects that the smartphone market there will fall another 7.1% this year before flattening next year. The ""biggest upside"" in the Asia/Pacific region comes from India, which IDC sees posting 14% growth in 2018 and 16% growth in 2019.

He wrote that Apple might have trouble achieving high attach rates for some of its services offerings due to the company's ""ecosystem-centric approach,"" given that his survey work indicates that only about a third of iPhone users also use Macs. He wrote that some Windows users might ""shun the Apple subscription services"" because the services wouldn't be easily compatible with all their devices. Chokshi also said that the company will face a lot of ""entrenched competition"" from Netflix Inc.

Net income for the quarter to May 5 rose to $379.8 million, or $1.01 a share, from $93.6 million, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.45, up from $1.03 last year, beat the FactSet consensus of $1.37. Revenue grew 47% to $1.51 billion from $1.15 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.47 billion, as better-than-expected industrial, consumer and communications revenue offset a miss in automotive revenue. For the third quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.38 to $1.52 and revenue of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion, which surround the FactSet consensus for EPS of $1.40 and for revenue of $1.49 billion.

Sessions refused the unusual demand during a March 2017 confrontation at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida, the Times reported. The confrontation has not been previously reported, and special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating it as possible evidence of obstruction, the Times said.

""In our view, the current valuations already reflect the upside case for the business,"" he wrote. ""Moreover, we're still concerned that their pace of innovation is running behind the industry - even with the release of the ICE4 products and their revamped two-year product iteration strategy."" On a competitive level, Notter is worried about recent management commentary on price competition, which makes him think that the maker of optical transmission equipment is ""not on the leading edge of price/performance.""

Volume in Petrobras jumped to 23.4 million shares, already above the full-day average of 22.6 million shares, and enough to make the stock the NYSE's most actively traded. After closing at a 3 1/2-year high on May 16, the stock had plunged 26% over the past seven sessions. Also weighing on Petrobras shares is the 5.3% drop in crude oil prices

The out-of-order pills might not be evident to women using the product, including previous users and new users, and thus could result in unintended pregnancy. Patients concerned about this should consult their doctor, Allergan said. The packaging error affected one lot of Taytulla, according to Allergan, a ""physicians sample pack"" that was distributed nationwide. (The lot, numbered 5620706, contains 28 pills and expires in May 2019.) The issue was discovered because of a physician report, Allergan said. Birth control pills must be taken faithfully each day in order to work effectively, experts say; one reproductive health professor told MarketWatch last year, ""it only takes missing a couple of birth control pills for a person to become pregnant."" Allergan shares declined 0.7% premarket.

                                         surged 2.9% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the energy infrastructure company announced the sale of the Trans Mountain Pipeline system and expansion project (TMEP) to the Government of Canada for the equivalent of about $3.46 billion (C$4.5 billion). The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan said that despite losing the EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) associated with the Trans Mountain system, the company expects to meet or exceed its 2018 outlook for distributable cash flow per share. The company said it expects its approximately 70% share of after-tax proceeds will be about $2.0 billion.

The stock slipped 0.6% in premarket trade. Analyst Rob Sanderson's new price target, which is 14% above Friday's closing price of $1,610.15, would give Amazon a market cap of $892.8 billion. ""[Amazon] continues to become the storefront and logistics infrastructure for a meaningful portion of the retail industry,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to clients. He said, however, that Amazon is not a top ""near-term"" pick, given the exceptional recent stock performance. The stock has shot up 6.1% since Amazon reported first-quarter results after the April 26 close, and has run up 61.7% over the past 12 months, compared with the S&P 500's

ESL, the hedge fund run by Sears' Chief Executive Eddie Lampert, said it asked Sears to reconsider the limits it has placed on ESL's ability to engage with potential partners for a deal. Since ESL made its proposal on April 20, ESL said there has been a ""significant increase"" in the price for Sears' unsecured debt that would make certain debt repurchases and debt-for-equity exchanges less attractive. ""We wanted to emphasize that finding an appropriate partner soon will be a critical factor that will materially impact any definitive proposal that we are able to make,"" ESL said in a letter to Sears' board of directors. ""Specifically, we believe that our ability to execute the ESL Proposal depends on our ability to engage with partners that can provide strategic and/or management experience to these businesses.""

Mattarella then asked Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, to try to form a new government. ""Cottarelli's administration may meet today and the new-Prime Minister has said he will look to pass a budget and then hold elections in early 2019. However, the new cabinet will require a confidence vote in parliament which it is unlikely to win and repeat elections in early autumn now look likely,"" said European analysts at RBC in a Tuesday note.

","LeBron James flexed his muscles, and the Cleveland Cavaliers will return to the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year after beating the Boston Celtics, 87-79, in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday night. In an often ugly, defense-dominated game, the Celtics shot just 18% from the 3-point line (7-for-39), and lost at home for the first time this postseason. James dominated Sunday's game, playing all 48 minutes and ending up with 35 points, 15 rebounds and 9 assists, and providing a dose of swagger that motivated his teammates to victory. It will be James' eighth straight Finals appearance; he's won three titles in that stretch. This year's trip to the Finals might be James' most impressive achievement, as he's surrounded by arguably his weakest supporting cast in that stretch. The NBA Finals will start Thursday, with the Cavs meeting either the Golden State Warriors or the Houston Rockets, who will face off in a Game 7 of their own on Monday night.",2018-05-27T23:13:00-04:00,"

Icahn Enterprises (IEP) said it was tendering up to 11.4 million Herbalife shares, or about a quarter of the 45.7 million shares, or 25.9% of the outstanding shares, it currently owns. Icahn Enterprises first acquired Herbalife shares at the end of 2012. Since then, of the 29 positions IEP holds, only three have been held longer than Herbalife. ""For almost six years, we have been one of Herbalife's strongest, most loyal supporters; we stood by the company through a half-decade long short-selling campaign; and we never sold a share, even after our investment doubled, said IEP Chairman Carl Icahn in a statement. ""But, given that our Herbalife investment has become an outsized position, representing approximately 24% exposure to total [net asset value], it is only prudent for IEP to reduce its exposure."" In February, Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital reportedly exited its $1 billion short bet on Herbalife.

Devitt's upgrade comes on the heels of the company's second-ever investor day, which took place Thursday in San Francisco. ""We believe PayPal is still in the early stages of its transformation from a button/online checkout company to a global payments platform with a sizable addressable market opportunity,"" Devitt wrote. He highlighted management's commentary around consumer choice, a once-controversial decision by PayPal to no longer steer customers away from funding their transactions with payment methods that are relatively more expensive for PayPal, such as credit cards. The company said Thursday that even with consumer choice in place, 70% of users have a lower-cost funding method as their preference. Devitt raised his price target to $99 from $82. He'd been on the sidelines for a year.

The charges are that he raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex on him, CNN reported. But Manhattan prosecutors are reported to be investigating other charges against the disgraced mogul, while separate investigations are under way in London and Los Angeles. The charges come just months after a stream of women told the New York Times and New Yorker magazine that Weinstein had sexually attacked or abused them in meetings going back 20 years and more. Many were young actresses and models who were just starting their careers. Weinstein has been moved to Manhattan Criminal Court and will face criminal sex charges later Friday.

                                         soared 12% in premarket trade Friday, after the specialty athletic retailer reported fiscal first-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations. Net income for the quarter to May 5 was $165 million, or $1.38 a share, compared with $180 million, or $1.36 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as a $12 million charge related to pension litigation, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.45, above the FactSet consensus of $1.25. Revenue rose 1.2% to $2.03 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.96 billion, as the 2.8% decline in same-store sales beat expectations of a 3.9% decline. Gross margin rate was 32.9% compared with 34.0% last year and merchandise inventories declined 5.4% to $1.21 billion.

                                         plunged 20% late Thursday after the fast-casual restaurant chain posted a larger-than-expected first-quarter loss, missed quarterly sales expectations, and cut its outlook for 2018. Zoe's Kitchen said it lost $3.6 million, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter, versus earnings of $19,000, breaking even on a per-share basis, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 13% to $102.1 million, the company said. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a loss of one penny per share on sales of $104.7 million for the quarter. Zoe's blamed its 2.3% same-restaurant sales decrease on weather and calendar shifts as well as less dine-in traffic. The analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected a 0.5% increase in same-restaurant sales. Zoe's also downgraded its outlook for 2018, saying it expects revenue between $345 million and $352 million, down from previous expectations of revenue between $358 million to $368 million, and same-restaurant sales down 2% to 4%, versus expectations of same-restaurant sales flat to 2% higher for the year. Shares of Zoe's Kitchen ended the regular trading day down 2.9%. ""While we are encouraged by results coming from investments in digital, delivery, and menu innovation, it is imperative that we take aggressive actions to re-focus our efforts on building sales and improving financial performance,"" Chief Executive Kevin Miles said. ""To do so, we will slow our future new unit growth and conduct a thorough review of under-performing restaurants. Additionally, we are taking steps to reduce our G&A infrastructure and will re-allocate resources towards marketing and technology initiatives to drive sales,"" he said in a statement.",2018-05-24T17:00:00-04:00,"

Gap said it earned $164 million, or 42 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $143 million, or 36 cents a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales rose 10% to $3.78 billion, from $3.44 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $3.61 billion for the quarter.

The company reaffirmed its 2018 per-share earnings guidance in the range of $2.55 to $2.70 despite ""the pressures we faced in the first quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said in a statement.
